Robust Indoor Localization via Conformal Methods and Variational
Bayesian Adaptive Filtering
Zhiyi Zhou, Dongzhuo Liu*, Songtao Guo, Senior Member, IEEE, and Yuanyuan Yang, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract—Indoor localization is critical for IoT applications,
yet challenges such as non-Gaussian noise, environmental in-
terference, and measurement outliers hinder the robustness
of traditional methods. Existing approaches, including Kalman
ﬁltering and its variants, often rely on Gaussian assumptions
or static thresholds, limiting adaptability in dynamic environ-
ments. This paper proposes a hierarchical robust framework
integrating Variational Bayesian (VB) parameter learning, Hu-
ber M-estimation, and Conformal Outlier Detection (COD) to
address these limitations. First, VB inference jointly estimates
state and noise parameters, adapting to time-varying uncer-
tainties. Second, Huber-based robust ﬁltering suppresses mild
outliers while preserving Gaussian efﬁciency. Third, COD pro-
vides statistical guarantees for outlier detection via dynamically
calibrated thresholds, ensuring a user-controlled false alarm
rate. Theoretically, we prove the Semi-positive Deﬁniteness of
Huber-based Kalman ﬁltering covariance and the coverage of
sliding window conformal prediction. Experiments on geomag-
netic ﬁngerprint datasets demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements:
ﬁngerprint matching accuracy increases from 81.25% to 93.75%,
and positioning errors decrease from 0.62–6.87 m to 0.03–0.35 m.
Comparative studies further validate the framework’s robustness,
showing consistent performance gains under non-Gaussian noise
and outlier conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION
I
NDOOR localization plays a pivotal role in enabling a
wide range of applications, from autonomous robotics
and wearable devices to smart buildings within the Internet
of Things (IoT) ecosystem. As a foundational technology,
accurate and reliable indoor localization is essential for ap-
plications such as navigation, asset tracking, and environmen-
tal monitoring. However, the inherent challenges of indoor
environments—such as severe signal degradation caused by
multipath effects and dynamic interference—complicate the
design of robust localization systems [1], [2]. These factors
introduce substantial measurement noise, making it difﬁcult to
ensure both the accuracy and reliability of indoor positioning.
Despite signiﬁcant progress, current indoor localization
methods are hindered by three major limitations:
• Reliance on simplifying Gaussian noise assumptions,
which do not hold in many practical scenarios.
• Fixed robustness thresholds that lack adaptability in dy-
namic environments.
• Absence of rigorous uncertainty quantiﬁcation for robust
decision-making.
Preprint.
Traditional ﬁltering approaches, such as the Kalman Filter
(KF) and its nonlinear variants, are optimal only under restric-
tive assumptions of Gaussian noise and linear system dynamics
[3]. Although the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) improves
handling of nonlinearities through the unscented transform,
it remains vulnerable to non-Gaussian noise and outliers.
Adaptive methods, such as variational Bayesian (VB) ﬁlters
[4] and Huber M-estimation [5], partially mitigate these issues
by addressing time-varying noise and suppressing moderate
outliers. However, VB ﬁlters introduce high computational
overhead, and Huber M-estimation’s ﬁxed threshold is not
robust to dynamically changing environments. While multi-
sensor fusion can improve accuracy, it often inherits distribu-
tional assumptions and model errors [6].
To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical
framework that combines variational Bayesian learning, Huber
robust ﬁltering, and Conformal Outlier Detection (COD). This
framework, built on the principles of Conformal Prediction
(CP), offers a robust solution to the challenges of adaptability
and reliability in indoor positioning tasks. By leveraging con-
formal inference, our approach provides statistically rigorous
conﬁdence intervals to detect and mitigate the impact of
outliers in real-time data, without making assumptions about
the underlying noise distribution. This adaptability allows the
framework to operate effectively in both Gaussian and non-
Gaussian environments.
At the core of Conformal Prediction is the ability to
construct prediction sets that reﬂect the uncertainty in the
model’s outputs. Speciﬁcally, CP quantiﬁes non-conformity
scores to identify outliers—samples that deviate signiﬁcantly
from the model’s expected behavior. In the context of indoor
localization, this capability is essential for detecting anomalies
caused by noisy or anomalous signal patterns. By incorpo-
rating COD, our framework can dynamically adjust the size
of the prediction set based on model conﬁdence, offering a
transparent view of the uncertainty in each prediction.
Our contributions are as follows:
• Adaptive Parameter Learning: We propose a VB-UKF
hybrid ﬁlter that simultaneously estimates state variables
and noise covariances, enabling real-time adaptation to
changing uncertainties.
• Dual-Layer Outlier Detection: We integrate Huber M-
estimation to suppress mild outliers and COD with
sliding-window calibration to provide statistical guaran-
tees (coverage ≥1 −α) for detecting severe anomalies.
• Theoretical Rigor: We provide proofs of semi-positive
deﬁniteness for Huber-weighted covariance matrices and
ﬁnite-sample coverage bounds for non-exchangeable time
series.

Experiments on geomagnetic ﬁngerprint datasets demon-
strate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method im-
proves ﬁngerprint matching accuracy from 81.25% to 93.75%,
and reduces positioning errors from 0.62–6.87 m to 0.03–0.35
m. Additionally, the framework remains robust in the pres-
ence of non-Gaussian noise, achieving 95% outlier detection
precision with controlled false alarms.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sec-
tion II reviews related work on localization, ﬁltering, and
uncertainty quantiﬁcation. Section III presents the details
of our proposed framework. Sections IV– V describe the
experimental setup and results, followed by conclusions in
Section V.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Indoor Localization Technologies
Indoor positioning technologies primarily include Wi-Fi [7],
Bluetooth [8], [9], geomagnetic [10], Inertial Measurement
Units (IMU) [11], and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) [12]. Wi-
Fi and Bluetooth-based methods rely on ﬁxed infrastructure,
facing challenges in terms of coverage, maintenance costs, and
security, which limit their widespread adoption [13]. UWB
technology, with its advantages of low power consumption,
long transmission range, and high data rate, has been widely
applied in inertial measurement and attitude recognition. Geo-
magnetic and IMU-based methods, leveraging built-in sensors
for passive positioning without external signals, exhibit high
autonomy, making them promising solutions for achieving
high-precision and cost-effective indoor positioning. However,
while inertial navigation systems offer strong autonomy, their
position and velocity errors accumulate rapidly over time. Sim-
ilarly, geomagnetic sensors suffer from limited measurement
accuracy and are susceptible to interference from currents and
other magnetic ﬁelds, leading to measurement anomalies.
B. Adaptive and Robust Filtering
Single-sensor technologies face inherent limitations. Al-
though multi-sensor data fusion can signiﬁcantly improve
positioning accuracy, it introduces modeling errors and typ-
ically assumes known noise distributions. To address these
challenges, researchers have developed various adaptive and
robust ﬁltering techniques. Adaptive ﬁlters, such as fading
memory ﬁlters [14], interactive multiple model ﬁlters [15],
variational Bayesian (VB)-based ﬁlters [4], and Gaussian sum
ﬁlters [16], excel in addressing modeling errors due to their
strong recursive reasoning capabilities. However, these ﬁlters
often perform poorly when measurement data contain outliers,
as their estimates are easily contaminated, leading to error
accumulation. Robust ﬁlters, such as those based on Huber’s
M-estimation and federated ﬁlters [17], are designed to handle
large measurement errors and outliers.
For instance, Li et al. [18] proposed an adaptive ﬁlter
combining Gaussian-Newton iteration and VB approximation,
capable of addressing both modeling errors and outliers in
non-Gaussian scenarios. Liu et al. [19] introduced a robust
variational Bayesian cubature Kalman ﬁlter (VBCKF) by
incorporating the maximum correntropy criterion, which im-
proved robustness to some extent. Davari et al. [20] combined
VB ﬁlters with hybrid artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) to
enable real-time outlier detection, but the high computational
complexity and resource requirements limit their applicability
in real-time scenarios. Yang et al. [21] proposed an adaptive
robust ﬁltering framework based on generalized maximum
likelihood estimation (GM estimation) and VB methods,
integrating the centered error entropy (CEE) criterion into
the framework to develop the VBCEECKF algorithm. This
approach enhanced robustness against outliers but required
complex iterative computations, increasing deployment costs.
Moreover, most existing ﬁltering algorithms are optimized for
speciﬁc noise distributions, making it challenging to maintain
robustness across diverse noise settings.
C. Uncertainty Quantiﬁcation and Outlier Detection
Uncertainty quantiﬁcation (UQ) in localization systems has
evolved signiﬁcantly over the past decade. Early approaches
primarily relied on probabilistic methods such as entropy
estimation and Bayesian credible intervals, which derive un-
certainty bounds from model outputs (e.g., softmax probabil-
ities) [22]. While these methods provide intuitive uncertainty
representations, their calibration often fails in practice due to
overﬁtting or distributional mismatches, leading to overconﬁ-
dent or overly conservative predictions [23].
The emergence of conformal prediction (CP) marked a
paradigm shift by offering distribution-free guarantees for
uncertainty quantiﬁcation. Unlike traditional methods, CP
constructs prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees
(1−α) without requiring explicit likelihood models [23]. This
model-agnostic framework has been widely adopted in clas-
siﬁcation tasks, where it quantiﬁes uncertainty by evaluating
the ”non-conformity” of new observations against a calibra-
tion set. However, its direct application to time-series data—
common in localization systems—faces inherent challenges
due to violated exchangeability assumptions. Recent advances
address this limitation through sliding window calibration [24]
and sequential conformal inference [25], which adaptively
adjust thresholds to temporal dependencies while maintaining
coverage guarantees. For instance, Xu et al. [25] demonstrated
theoretically grounded prediction intervals for non-stationary
time series, achieving robust performance in both simulated
and real-world navigation tasks.
In parallel, CP has been tailored to address outlier detec-
tion in dynamic environments. Strawn et al. [26] integrated
CP with reinforcement learning to design safety ﬁlters for
collision avoidance, reducing collision rates by 80% in robotic
navigation. Similarly, Yang et al. [27] leveraged CP to quantify
perception uncertainty in LiDAR-based autonomous systems,
achieving 93% safety rates under stochastic sensor noise.
These works highlight CP’s versatility in bridging uncertainty
quantiﬁcation with real-time decision-making.
Beyond robotics, CP has spurred innovations in sensor
fusion and optimization. Garcia et al. [28] proposed multi-view
conformal models, showing superior coverage performance
over single-sensor baselines in heterogeneous environments.
3
Meanwhile, Kim et al. [29] addressed model misspeciﬁcation
in Bayesian optimization via localized conformal calibration,
outperforming traditional Gaussian process-based methods in
engineering design tasks.
Despite these advancements, critical gaps persist in adapting
CP to resource-constrained IoT localization systems. Existing
studies often assume centralized computation or static envi-
ronments, overlooking the challenges of real-time calibration
in dynamic indoor settings with limited sensor bandwidth.
Furthermore, while methods like sliding window CP [24] relax
i.i.d. assumptions, their theoretical guarantees for non-linear
state-space models—central to geomagnetic localization—
remain underdeveloped.
III. SYSTEM DESIGN
A. Geomagnetic characteristics and data preprocessing
Geomagnetic matching (MFM), as a passive positioning
technology, utilizes the data of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld
intensity and combines ﬁngerprint matching for positioning.
In this section, we collect geomagnetic data from different in-
door locations to establish a geomagnetic ﬁngerprint database,
which is the main task in the ofﬂine phase. Then, we analyze
its characteristics and determine the feasibility of using this
technology for indoor positioning.
Liu et al. [30] pointed out that under the same path, the
geomagnetic ﬁngerprint data has a relatively high matching
accuracy, that is, the collected geomagnetic signal time series
has a relatively high similarity. Therefore, the path matching
problem can be transformed into a time series matching
problem. By collecting the geomagnetic intensity data of the
same path from May to August 2024, we observed that the
geomagnetic characteristics of the collected data remained
consistent over a long period of time, even though the user
heights and walking speeds were different, as shown in Fig-
ure 1.

It is important to note that the geomagnetic data collection
using geomagnetic sensors is performed in a carrier coordinate
system (CCS), where the x-, y-, and z-axes correspond to the
directions of the device’s right side, front, and top, respec-
tively. Therefore, analyzing the data collected in the carrier
coordinate system is meaningless. It is necessary to convert the
three-axis geomagnetic data into a global coordinate system
(GCS). Let the magnetic ﬁeld strength vector in the sensor’s
coordinate system be denoted as MCCS. To transform it
into the global coordinate system MGCS, we apply three
Euler angle-based rotation matrices, corresponding to rotations
around the x-, y-, and z-axes:
Rx(θroll) =


1
0

−sin(θroll)

Besides, geomagnetic ﬁngerprint data exhibits strong lo-
cation dependence and is susceptible to ﬂuctuations due to
local environmental changes. In contrast, inertial sensor data
tends to be stable over short periods but accumulates errors
over time. By fusing these two data types, we can effectively
leverage the global characteristics of geomagnetic ﬁngerprints
and the local characteristics of inertial data. This fusion sig-
niﬁcantly reduces the errors caused by inertial drift, achieving
high-accuracy location estimation.
B. Variational Bayesian Adaptive Filtering Framework
In the online phase, the system continuously updates its
state estimate through real-time processing of Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) ﬁngerprints, combining variational
Bayesian learning with unscented transform to achieve robust
nonlinear ﬁltering. We ﬁrst formalize the discrete-time state-
space model:
xk = f(xk−1) + wk−1,
wk−1 ∼N(0, Qk−1)
(4)
zk = h(xk) + vk,
vk ∼N(0, Rk)
(5)
where f(·) and h(·) are nonlinear state transition and obser-
vation functions. Assuming both the process noise wk and
the measurement noise vk are zero-mean Gaussian variables
simpliﬁes the construction of the model. However, in practical
scenarios, the measurement noise covariance matrix is often
unknown or time-varying, which can signiﬁcantly affect the
accuracy of the estimates and reduce the system’s robustness
to outliers. As a result, Kalman ﬁltering and its variants, which
are effective for solving simpliﬁed models, may no longer
provide accurate solutions in such cases.
To address these challenges, this paper focuses on adaptive
ﬁltering techniques that combine the Variational Bayesian
(VB) approximation with the Adaptive Unscented Kalman Fil-
ter (AUKF), a method that has been demonstrated to enhance
4
adaptability and robustness in [18]. The speciﬁc steps of this
framework are as follows:
1) Sigma Point Generation: For state vector x ∈Rn,
generate 2n + 1 sigma points:

3) Variational Parameter Prediction: For measurement
noise covariance Rk ∼IW(vk, Vk) (inverse-Wishart):
vk|k−1 = ρ(vk−1 −n −1) + n + 1,
(10)
Vk|k−1 = √ρVk−1
√ρT
(11)
where ρ ∈(0, 1] governs temporal correlation.
The variational Bayesian framework aims to approxi-
mate the true posteriorp(xk, Rk|z1:k) by maximizing the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the variational
distributionq(xk, Rk) and the true posterior. This is equivalent
to maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):
ELBO = Eq [log p(zk|xk, Rk)] + Eq [log p(xk|xk−1)] −
KL (q(Rk)∥p(Rk)) −KL (q(xk)∥p(xk|xk−1)) ,
(12)
where p(Rk) is the inverse-Wishart prior and q(Rk) is the
variational posterior.
The inverse-Wishart distribution is chosen as the conjugate
prior for the measurement noise covariance Rk, ensuring
closed-form updates during variational inference. This avoids
complex numerical integration and maintains computational
efﬁciency.

The framework provides three fundamental advantages:
• Adaptive Noise Estimation: Joint state and noise covari-
ance estimation through variational inference
• Nonlinear Handling: Unscented transform maintains
second-order accuracy without linearization
• Computational Efﬁciency: Fixed iteration count ensures
real-time operation
C. Hierarchical Outlier Handling Mechanism
1) Huber Robust Update: In M-estimation, the predictor
update is often framed as a weighted least squares problem. By
constructing a nonlinear regression measurement model and
minimizing the generalized Huber loss function, the corrected
measurement values can be derived.
5
To mitigate the impact of mild outliers on state estimation,
a Huber loss function is adopted to construct the weighting
matrix. The piecewise weighting function is deﬁned as:
W(rk) =
(
1,
|rk| ≤δ
δ/|rk|,
|rk| > δ
(20)
where rk = zk −Hˆxk|k−1 is the measurement residual, and
δ denotes the robustness threshold. A recommended value is
δ = 1.345σ, where σ represents the standard deviation of the
observation noise.
The Huber weighting is incorporated into the standard
Kalman update, resulting in the modiﬁed Kalman gain:
Kk = Pk|k−1HT  HPk|k−1HT + R/W(rk)
−1
(21)
The term R/W(rk) adaptively downweights anomalous
observations: when |rk| > δ, W(rk) < 1, thereby increasing
the effective measurement noise covariance.
Theorem 1 (Huber-Weighted Posterior Covariance). Given the
Huber-modiﬁed posterior covariance matrix:
Pk|k = (I −WkKkH)Pk|k−1(I −WkKkH)T + WkKkRKT
k
(22)
where:
• Wk ≥0 is the Huber weighting factor
• Pk|k−1 ≻0 is the prior covariance
• R ≻0 is the measurement noise covariance
Then Pk|k remains positive semi-deﬁnite, i.e., Pk|k ⪰0.
Details on the proof process are provided in Appendix A.

2) Conformal Outlier Detection: While the Huber function
provides robustness against moderate outliers, its dependence
on a static threshold limits adaptability to dynamic noise
environments. To address this, we introduce a conformal
outlier detection mechanism as a secondary defense layer,
offering statistical guarantees for error control.
This section begins with a formulation of the indoor posi-
tioning problem, followed by an overview of the fundamental
CP framework. Finally, we incorporate conformal outlier de-
tection to enhance the robustness of the ﬁlter.
a) Problem Formulation: The ﬁngerprint-based indoor
localization is ﬁrst modeled as a classiﬁcation task. Given an
ofﬂine dataset of n i.i.d. RSSI-location pairs {(Xi, Yi)}n
i=1,
let ˆf : X →∆K be a probabilistic predictor that outputs a
distribution over K candidate locations, where ∆K denotes the
probability simplex. For each test instance Xtest, we quantify
its conformity to the training distribution through a non-
conformity score.
b) Conformal Prediction Framework: Deﬁne s : X ×
Y →R as the non-conformity score:
s(Xi, Yi) = 1 −ˆf(Xi)Yi
(23)
where ˆf(Xi)Yi denotes the predicted probability for the true
class Yi.
Compute the ⌈(n + 1)(1 −α)⌉-th quantile as conformal
threshold:
ˆq = inf

q : |{i : si ≤q}|
n
≥⌈(n + 1)(1 −α)⌉
n

(24)
Then we can build the prediction set:
C(Xtest) = {y ∈{1, . . ., K} : s(Xtest, y) ≤ˆq}
(25)
This construction guarantees marginal coverage:
P (Ytest ∈C(Xtest)) ≥1 −α
(26)
c) Extension to Filtering Framework: For sequential lo-
calization tasks, we adapt the conformal framework to handle
time-series data:
First we maintain a sliding window of w recent samples
Ck = {sk−w, . . . , sk−1} to build a dynamic calibration set.
Then deﬁne the non-conformity score as Filter-Aware Scor-
ing using normalized innovation:
sk = ∥zk −Hˆxk|k−1∥S−1
k
(27)
Sk = HPk|k−1H⊤+ Rk
(28)
Finally, the adaptive thresholding:
ˆqk = Quantile

Ck; ⌈(w + 1)(1 −α)⌉
w

(29)
d) Outlier Handling Mechanism: When sk > ˆqk, indi-
cating statistical inconsistency:
Rk ←γRk
(γ > 1)
(30)
This covariance inﬂation strategy temporarily reduces outlier
inﬂuence while maintaining ﬁlter stability.
Theorem 2 (Time-Varying Coverage). Under exchangeability
within the sliding window, the adaptive threshold ˆqk satisﬁes:
P(sk ≤ˆqk) ≥1 −α −O

e) Effectiveness: To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, consider a scenario where we have n = 20 test
samples and need to determine whether a new test point is
an outlier. First, we normalize the calculation results of non-
conformity score(NS) and sort the NSs in ascending order.
The closer the score is to 1, the higher the probability that
the test point is an outlier. The objective is to identify as
many outliers as possible while ensuring that no more than
α = 0.05 of the non-outliers are incorrectly classiﬁed as
outliers. Figure 2 illustrates the results of this procedure using
an outlier detection model.
IV. EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
A. Numerical Simulation
To effectively evaluate the accuracy and robustness of
the designed ﬁlter, this study selects a classical nonlinear
numerical case, namely the Univariate Nonstationary Growth
Model (UNGM), to demonstrate the ﬁlter’s performance. The
discrete-time state-space equation of the UNGM can be ex-

k =
(

(34)
3) Case c: Measurement noise follows a mixture of Gaus-
sian istributions:
rc
k ∼(1 −a)N(r1,k|0, R2

(35)
where a is a disturbance factor representing the extent of
contamination in the error model, and R1 and R2 are the
standard deviations of the Gaussian distributions. The
ﬁrst Gaussian distribution is a standard Gaussian, while
the second distribution is considered a perturbation dis-
tribution. The larger the value of a, the more signiﬁcant
the disturbance.
4) Case d: This case combines both b and c, with measure-
ment noise following a Gaussian mixture distribution rc
k,
where the variance is time-varying Rc

The measurement values are shown in Figure 3. And the
simulation results of VB-based ﬁlter and CP-based ﬁler for
four different measurement noises are shown in Figure 4. It
can be observed that CP method can effectively improve the
ﬁlter effect when the noise is case a and case b, while for c
and d, although the improvement effect is not signiﬁcant, it
further inhibits the inﬂuence of outliers on the basis of the
original robust algorithm.
We selected two classical ﬁlters, namely the Particle Filter
(PF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), a robust Huber-
based UKF (HUKF), and two adaptive robust ﬁlters for the
simulation. The results are presented in Figure 5. It is evident
that as the impact of outliers increases, the advantage of adap-
tive robust ﬁlters becomes more pronounced. After applying
the conformal outlier detection method proposed in this paper,
all ﬁlters show improved performance. Interestingly, even the
classical ﬁlters, which typically perform worse than adaptive

robust ﬁlters, are able to effectively mitigate the inﬂuence of
measurement noise with contaminated distributions.
To quantitatively validate the robustness improvements,
Table I compares the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of ﬁve ﬁlters
under four noise scenarios, both with and without conformal
outlier detection (We mark it simply as CP in the ﬁgures,
and in the following text as well) enhancement. Three key
observations emerge:
• Universal
Performance
Gain:
CP
integration
re-
duces MSE across all ﬁlters and noise types. The
most signiﬁcant improvement occurs in Case c (non-
Gaussian mixture), where UKF’s MSE decreases by
53.2% (200.70→93.89), demonstrating CP’s effectiveness
against heavy-tailed distributions.
• Classical vs. Adaptive Filters: While adaptive ﬁlters
(VB-AUKF/VB-HAUKF) achieve lower baseline MSE,
classical ﬁlters show greater relative improvement with
CP. For instance, PF achieves 21.3% MSE reduction
in Case d versus 1.3% for VB-HAUKF, suggesting CP
compensates for classical methods’ weaker inherent ro-
bustness.
• Noise-Type Dependency: CP provides maximum bene-
ﬁt in time-varying non-Gaussian scenarios (Cases c/d),
reducing average MSE by 46.7% compared to 21.9% in
stationary Gaussian cases (Cases a/b). This aligns with
the visual trends of Figure 4 and Figure 5.
Notably,
the
proposed
VB-HAUKF+CP
combination
achieves
the
lowest
absolute
MSE
in
all
scenarios
(49.16∼98.88), outperforming second-best VB-AUKF+CP
by 6.1%∼9.4%. This demonstrates the synergistic effect
of variational Bayesian adaptation and CP-based outlier
rejection.
To visually illustrate the effectiveness of the ﬁlters, Figure 6

the four ﬁlters under different conditions, which reveal three
critical insights about ﬁlter performance:
• Tail Behavior Characterization: In heavy-tailed sce-
narios (Cases c/d), the proposed CP-based combination
exhibits the steepest CDF ascent within the low-error
8
region (e.g., < 100 in Fig. 6c), with 90% of errors below
95 versus 107 for vanilla UKF. This indicates effective
suppression of outlier-induced large errors. The CP-
enhanced curves (dashed lines) show compressed right
tails compared to original ﬁlters (solid lines), particularly
visible in 95th percentile range.
• Consistency Across Noise Types: While adaptive ﬁlters
(VB-AUKF/VB-HAUKF) maintain tight error distribu-
tions in Gaussian cases (Cases a/b), CP brings classical
ﬁlters (UKF) closer to their performance. For instance,
in Case a, UKF+CP reaches 95% CDF at 51 error—even
higher slightly than VB-HAUKF+CP, despite UKF’s
baseline being 71 worse.
• Algorithmic Robustness Trade-off: The HUKF’s CDF
curves demonstrate median error robustness but falter
in extreme cases—its 95th percentile error in Case c
reaches more than 220 versus 100 for VB-HAUKF+CP.
This
quantiﬁes
the
trade-off between
heuristic ro-
bustness (HUKF) and learning-based adaptation (VB-
HAUKF+CP).
These observations align with the MSE metrics in Ta-
ble I while providing new dimensionality: the CDFs quantify
not just average performance but error distribution shap-
ing—critical for safety-sensitive applications where bounding
worst-case errors is paramount.

B. Implementation Experiment
In order to evaluate the actual positioning performance of
the method proposed in this paper, we designed an indoor
positioning and navigation system and conducted experiments
on the third and ﬁfth ﬂoors of the experimental building at
Southwest University. Figure 7 shows the experimental scene
and provides the plane proﬁle of the experimental site. The
experimental grid was divided every 3 meters, and nodes were
marked with location labels. Geomagnetic ﬁngerprints were
used to locate the nodes, and the detailed position coordinates
were obtained with the assistance of inertial data.
The basic procedure of the experiment includes the es-
tablishment of a ﬁngerprint database, real-time RSSI data
acquisition, data fusion prediction via ﬁltering, ﬁngerprint
matching of unknown coordinates, and the output of the
current position information.
The RSSI measurements were obtained using a high-
precision 9-axis geomagnetic sensor in real-time. The ex-
perimental equipment consisted of the STM32F103 MCU,
WHEELTEC H30 high-precision 9-axis IMU sensor (which
includes a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and 3-axis
magnetometer), and the related software and hardware tools
for geomagnetic matching algorithms, such as the USART
HMI, Matlab(R2024a), and XCOM serial debugging tool.
Additionally, portable computing devices were employed for
real-time data processing and analysis.
The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy
of the indoor single-point ﬁngerprint matching algorithm,
when enhanced with the conformal outlier detection method
proposed in this paper, improved from 81.25% to 93.75%.
Furthermore, the positioning error was signiﬁcantly reduced,
from a range of 0.62–6.87 m to just 0.03–0.35 m.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a novel approach to improving indoor
localization performance by integrating conformal outlier de-
tection with a geomagnetic/inertial-based ﬁngerprinting sys-
tem. The proposed method addresses common challenges in
indoor positioning by providing a robust and adaptive solution
that is independent of noise distributions. Through extensive
experimental validation, the framework demonstrated a sig-
niﬁcant improvement in positioning accuracy and reliability,
with the ﬁngerprint matching algorithm’s accuracy increasing
from 81.25% to 93.75% and positioning errors reduced from
0.62–6.87 m to 0.03–0.35 m.
The results highlight the effectiveness of conformal predic-
tion in mitigating outlier inﬂuence and enhancing the robust-
ness of indoor localization systems. The method’s ability to
adapt to dynamic environments and non-Gaussian noise makes
it particularly well-suited for real-world IoT applications,
including autonomous navigation, wearable devices, and smart
buildings.
PROOF: SEMI-POSITIVE DEFINITENESS PROOF OF
HUBER-KF COVARIANCE
Proof. The proof establishes the positive semi-deﬁniteness of
the posterior covariance matrix through three steps:
Step 1: Term Decomposition
Decompose the posterior covariance into two terms:
Pk|k = (I −WkKkH)Pk|k−1(I −WkKkH)T
|
{z
}
T1
+ WkKkRKT
k
|
{z
}
T2
(37)
Step 2: Individual Semi-Deﬁniteness Analysis
• Term T1:
T1 = APk|k−1AT
where A = I −WkKkH
⪰0
(as Pk|k−1 ≻0 and A is real)
• Term T2:
T2 = WkKkRKT
k
⪰0
(since R ≻0 and Wk ≥0)
Step 3: Summation Property
The summation preserves semi-deﬁniteness:
Pk|k = T1 + T2 ⪰0
(38)
Boundary Case Validation:
• Case 1: Wk = 0 (no measurement update):
Pk|k = Pk|k−1 ≻0
(39)
• Case 2: Wk > 0: Both T1 and T2 contribute positively
to Pk|k ⪰0.
Hence, Pk|k ⪰0 holds for all valid Wk ≥0.
PROOF: COVERAGE PROPERTY OF SLIDING WINDOW
CONFORMAL PREDICTION
Let {(Xk, Yk)}K
k=1 be a time series data stream. At each
time step k > w, we maintain a sliding calibration set
Ck = {sk−w, . . . , sk−1} where w is the window size, and
si = s(Xi, Yi) are non-conformity scores.
Modiﬁed Exchangeability Assumption
Assume the scores in the extended window Ck ∪{sk} are
approximately exchangeable within any temporal block of size
w + 1. This weakens the i.i.d. assumption while preserving
local stationarity.
Adaptive Quantile Construction
Deﬁne the sliding window quantile estimate:
ˆqk = inf

q : |{s ∈Ck : s ≤q}|
w
≥⌈(w + 1)(1 −α)⌉


Coverage Analysis
Theorem 3. Under the block exchangeability assumption, the
sliding window conformal predictor satisﬁes:
|P(sk ≤ˆqk) −(1 −α)| ≤
C
√w
where C depends on the mixing coefﬁcient of the time series.
Proof. Deﬁne the martingale difference sequence:
Dk = I{sk ≤ˆqk} −(1 −α)

Setting ǫ = C/√w yields the stated bound.

Practical Interpretation
The coverage gap decays as O(1/√w), implying:
• For w = 1000, the coverage deviation is bounded by
∼3%
• Window size controls tradeoff between adaptivity and
statistical guarantees
• The bound holds for α-mixing processes [31]
