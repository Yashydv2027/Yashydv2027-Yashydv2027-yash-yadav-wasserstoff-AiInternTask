Abstract: For the preparation of the operation of multiple Rare Isotope Beams (RIBs) when
the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) becomes operational, TRIUMF embarked on a
program of advanced beam tuning applications and machine learning tools. The strategy for the
application of Bayesian Optimization for beam steering purposes is being developed. A previously
reported Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to tune accelerated charged particle beams at
TRIUMF‚Äôs ISAC postaccelerator facility. We present findings and results from multiple machine
development experiments conducted between October and November 2024, as part of a pivot
toward semi-automated machine tuning methods. These findings were instrumental in shaping the
tuning strategy for the medium and high energy beam transport (MEBT, HEBT) lines at ISAC, by
sequentially optimizing sub-sections of the beamlines.

Introduction
The Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) facility [1] is built around a post-accelerator chain:
An initial step Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) [2] accelerator linked to a Drift Tube Linac
(DTL) [3] by a medium energy section with a 90‚ó¶corner, enabling charge beam mass-to-charge
(ùê¥/ùëû) selection. The RFQ accelerates beam from 2.04 keV/u to an output energy of 153 keV/u,
which is then injected into the DTL. The separated function [4] DTL allows for a fully variable
energy output, starting at 153 keV/u to a maximum of 1.53 MeV/u. These linac properties divide
the ISAC facility into three energy regimes:
‚Ä¢ Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT): 2.04 keV/u
‚Ä¢ Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT): 153 keV/u
‚Ä¢ High Energy Beam Transport (HEBT): 0.153-1.53 MeV/u
In the past, tuning the ISAC beamlines was entirely done by manual adjustment of quadrupoles
and corrective steerers, with a singular focus on the beam current transmission. This was a time-
consuming procedure which led to highly variable tuning times to experiments, especially due to
the limited availability of operators and the simultaneous delivery of rare and stable isotope beams.
Furthermore, higher availability of rare isotope beams is expected once TRIUMF‚Äôs ARIEL facility
comes online.
‚Äì 1 ‚Äì
Consequently, a philosophical change in the operational tuning methodology used for beam
delivery at ISAC is required, with a switch to more automated and model-based tuning techniques.
Significant effort has been placed on simplifying the process of beam tuning and delivery to exper-
iments, using a mixture of parallel modeling [5, 6] and optimization software [7, 8]. By utilizing
knowledge of the beam dynamics at ISAC and a speedy beam envelope code (TRANSOPTR [9]), a
complement of control room applications have been developed to augment the operators‚Äô capabili-
ties and minimize tuning times to experiments. This will allow the facility to run more efficiently
and help prepare the operators for the arrival of ARIEL.
Rare isotope beam experiments can last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks. Since the
required beam energy, mass-to-charge ratio, and species continually change between experiments,
beam tuning at ISAC is carried out using a start-to-end model of the machine to calculate the
necessary tune for achieving the desired beam parameters. This process is managed operationally
through the Model Coupled Accelerator Tuning (MCAT) control room application [10]. However,
obtaining the initial beam conditions at various operational sources (such as initial centroid posi-
tion and divergence) can be challenging, which necessitates adjustments using corrective steering
elements (see Figure 1).
This report outlines significant upgrades to the operational tuning strategy for rare isotope
beam delivery at TRIUMF‚Äôs RIB postaccelerator. Over a two-month testing period, four distinct
machine development tests were conducted, using several different beam species, with a focus on
the medium and high-energy sections. The report discusses the optimal tuning strategies identified
from the MEBT corner to the HEBT2 sections, including results from the machine development
experiments. The optimal steerer setpoints, which ensure improved beam transmission through the
linac and beamlines, are determined through Bayesian optimization [8]. It also presents the time
required for tuning, along with recommendations for faster optimization. Finally, the report outlines
plans for future work to address both pre-existing and newly identified issues.

Bayesian Optimization for Ion Steering
2.1
Bayesian Optimization
Owing to diagnostic availability, finding the steerer values that maximize transmission is treated as
a black box problem where each evaluation is costly. Bayesian optimization is well suited for this
problem, where the goal is to build a probabilistic model which accurately represents the objective
function. This can be done by defining a surrogate model based on prior information, typically
a Gaussian process (GP) [11].
With a zero mean prior, a Gaussian process becomes entirely
defined by the kernel. The kernel calculates the similarity between pairs of input data points to
find the covariance matrix, which allows for the calculation of the posterior distribution. Bayesian
Optimization for Ion Steering (BOIS) was developed at TRIUMF to optimize the corrective steerer
problem at ISAC, with majority testing in the low energy beam transport (LEBT) section [8]. The
kernel used in BOIS is the Mat√©rn Kernel [12]. BOIS has an initial sampling stage where the
inputs are randomly selected based on their mid-points, followed by the training stage where the
optimization is carried out.
2.2
Optimizing the Acquisition Function
The acquisition function (AF) determines the selection of the next best input values to test. Op-
timizing the AF is a critical step for the Bayesian Optimization approach. Typically there is a
hyperparameter which controls the balance of exploration vs exploitation. Focusing on exploration
biases the AF to find areas in the input space with high uncertainties, whereas exploitation focuses
on areas presently known to produce high objective function value (and thus potentially missing
a global optimum). A good balance is required to avoid getting stuck in a local maxima while
ensuring efficient sampling of the input space.
3
Tuning Sequences
Since Bayesian optimization is typically most effective for problems with smaller dimensions [13],
beamline segments for optimization must be carefully selected to keep the number of optimization
variables manageable, typically under 20. By dividing the full machine optimization into several
smaller segments, each overlapping with the previous one, greater efficiency and reliable operation
are achieved. These segments are selected based on the availability of diagnostics and the typical
operator tuning procedures. Each sequence includes steering elements and beam current monitors,
such as Faraday Cups (FC), although some sequences, such as the MEBT section, also incorporate
quadrupoles to account for modeling uncertainties, which are being separately investigated. Further
discussion of this necessity is presented in [14, 15], however the determined bounds for BOIS‚Äôs
quadrupole adjustments are ¬±10% of the MCAT computed quadrupole gradients.
The first sequence starts in the MEBT corner and goes through the DTL to the start of HEBT
(Fig. 1, MEBT:FC5 to HEBT:FC5). This is the only sequence where quadrupoles are tuned due
to disagreements between the model and the observed tune. None of the DTL or HEBT elements
are tuned in this sequence, it is purely a DTL injection optimization problem. Sequences 2-5 cover
HEBT and HEBT2, sequence 2 is found to be trivial for the optimizer and will likely be combined
with sequence 3 in the future.

Results
4.1
MEBT Corner and DTL
The beam species was 84Kr15+ from the multicharge ion source (MCIS) terminal at OLIS, accelerated
by the DTL to E/A=461 keV/u. This development period was focused on testing different sequence
definitions and optimizing through the MEBT corner.
The objective was to maximize beam
transmission as measured from one Faraday cup to the next.
The optimizations were performed using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) [16] acquisition
function where the exploration vs exploitation hyperparameter (ùõΩ1) was kept at ùõΩ= 3. The initial
tests excluded all quadrupoles, which failed to exceed 65% transmission across the DTL. Figure
2 shows the relevant tests where quadrupoles were included in the optimizations. Keeping them
unbounded was unsuccessful, producing 5% transmission across DTL. Bounding the quadrupoles
to ¬±10% of the MCAT values yielded a DTL transmission of 100%. Finally, note:
1. Operators noticed one of the MEBT corrective steerers tripped repeatedly during the tests,
which could be related to unipolar power-supply and polarity switch operation [17].
2. Current entering the MEBT section fell from 6.2nA at the start of testing to 5.5nA by the end,
likely due to ion source output current variation.

4.2
HEBT to HEBT2
Tests were carried out using both Expected Improvement (EI) [18] and UCB, it was found that
EI generally converges faster but is less consistent.
Transmission optimization was achieved
using sequences 2-5. The Bayesian optimizer was run with EI and ùõΩ=10, which produced high
transmission for Sequence 2. However, note that this is a straight beamline segment featuring a
relatively large aperture (2.54 cm beampipe radius) and an absence of notable constrictions. High
transmission is found initially during the random sampling stage, before an acquisition function is
even used.
Sequence 3 was more challenging due to the presence of bunching cavities, which remained
unpowered, whose drift tubes possess a 1 cm aperture radius [19], compared to the 2.54 cm beampipe
radius. Figure 3 shows the explored input space with expected improvement for ùõΩ= 1.
Figure 3. Explored input space during optimization for EI with ùõΩ= 1.
In this case, the BOIS algorithm failed with significant over-exploration. As a result, transmis-
sion was at a minimum, in the ‚âà1 ‚àí5% range. This issue was later found to be with the BoTorch
package [20]: The previously employed version was 0.11.3, however upgrading to version 0.13
fixed this issue. A future investigation will look at these acquisition functions and the issues en-
countered in more detail, however it is noted that strict version adherence will be necessary to avoid
functionality problems. As a result, it was resolved to employ UCB for this section with ùõΩ= 3.
This configuration proved the most reliable, delivering a measured transmission of 93% through
this section. Figure 4 shows the expected input space exploration.

Figure 4. Explored input space during optimization for UCB with ùõΩ= 3.
Sequences 4-5 were optimized with UCB, shown in Figure 5. Total tuning time was ‚âà42
minutes. This can be reduced with future development, as the maximum transmission is often
found very early during the optimization. Implementing an early stoppage option will address
this. A full implementation of early stoppage requires two critera: 1) Beam transmission reaches
a pre-determined threshold. 2) No improvement in beam transmission after a given number of
iterations. It is also possible to set the hyperparameter ùõΩ= 0 to maximally exploit the best inputs
for ‚àº5 iterations after a condition is met.

4.3
Combining Sequences 2-5
Figure 6. Single optimization problem where Sequences 2-5 are combined.
To demonstrate the inefficacy of optimizing long stretches of the beamline with a large optimiza-
tion problem, a test was conducted where Sequences 2-5 were combined into a single optimization
problem, involving 14 corrective steerers. Figure 6 illustrates the results, with the most noticeable
observation being the lack of improvement over iterations. The best point reached during random
sampling was never exceeded, and the final transmission from HEBT:FC0 to HEBT2:FC4 was 68%,
significantly lower than the 86% achieved using smaller sequences.
4.4
Tuning Time Estimates
With a beam species of 12C3+ (Table 2, Test 1) at 464 keV/u, another test was carried out with the
goal of recording a time-estimate of BOIS transmission optimizations from Sequences 1-5. Manual
stoppage was used when transmission reached 90-95% or ceased to improve. Table 1 shows the
tuning times per sequence. Sequence 3 was again more challenging for BOIS to optimize. Matching
through the HEBT bunchers is a likely cause for the transmission difficulties due to the aperture
restrictions of the HEBT bunchers [19]. Further scrutiny of this section will be carried out in the
future to better understand and address this.

Further Tests
Two final tests were carried out, first using 12C3+ (Table 2, Test 2) at 464 keV/u, and then 133Cs21+
at 254 keV/u, both from the MCIS source. The carbon beam test suffered from current degradation
due to an ion source failure, leading to a reduction in available beam for testing. The caesium
beam also suffered from similar source issues. In both cases, significant (>20%) beam current
fluctuations were recorded at irregular intervals. Testing proceeded during periods of relative beam
stability.

Summary
BOIS consistently achieves high transmission rates across the medium and high energy sections
while maintaining a short tuning time, provided the problem is suitably divided into appropriate
sub-sections for optimization. This has been tested with multiple beam compositions, mass to
charge ratios and final energies. These results, listed in Table 2, will inform the development of
BOIS as a control room application for operator use when tuning the ISAC postaccelerator for beam
delivery. With the aforementioned methodology, tuning from the MEBT corner to HEBT2 takes
28 minutes, which is comparable to the tuning times achieved by the operators.

Future Work
While these results are very promising, there are several improvements required for fully reliable
operation, with some requiring machine development shifts for testing:
‚Ä¢ Implement early stoppage as a part of BOIS, this will be especially useful once the control
room application is deployed.
‚Ä¢ Minimize steering by bounding the inputs, this has been developed with boundBOIS, reported
in [8], but not extensively tested in the medium to high energy beamlines.
‚Ä¢ Include the best input values from previous runs in the initial sampling stage, which are scaled
for beam ùê¥/ùëûfor the present species. Currently, initial sampling uses a random process which
calculates test values from the midpoint of the bounds.
‚Ä¢ The beam current as measured on the Faraday cup is averaged over 20 measurements, this is
redundant as the wait time between each measurement (0.01s) is far quicker than the response
time for the control room application webserver (0.2s). It is best to average over a smaller
number of measurements and provide the proper wait times between the measurements.
