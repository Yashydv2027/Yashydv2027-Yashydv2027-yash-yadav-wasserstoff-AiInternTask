Abstract
Bamboo slips are a crucial medium for recording ancient civilizations in East Asia, and offers
invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk Road, studying material culture ex-
changes, and global history.
However, many excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into
thousands of irregular pieces, making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding
their content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework designed
to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips.
Based on the physics of fracture and material deterioration,
WisePanda automatically generates synthetic training data that captures the physical properties of
bamboo fragmentations. This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring
manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the rejoining process. Compared
to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to
52%. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced substantial efficiency improvements (approx-
imately 20 times faster) when rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that
incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly enhance their perfor-
mance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides
a new paradigm for addressing data scarcity in ancient artifact restoration through physics-driven
machine learning.
Main
Bamboo slips, serving as a fundamental medium for documenting ancient East Asian civilizations, con-
tain invaluable historical records spanning philosophy, law, and social life period [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Their
durability has enabled these artifacts to survive millennia underground while retaining legible content [6],
offering scholars unprecedented insights into historical societies. However, the excavation of these deli-
cate artifacts presents a critical challenge [7] - many bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands
of pieces (Figure 1), significantly complicating efforts to reconstruct and interpret their content. This
fragmentation creates a fundamental obstacle in accessing the wealth of historical knowledge contained
in these artifacts.
The rejoining of fragmented bamboo slips represents one of the most challenging problems in archaeo-
logical preservation and cultural heritage studies [8]. The difficulty stems from multiple factors: First, the
enormous number of potential fragment combinations makes manual matching extremely time-consuming
- for instance, The Qin bamboo slips from the Shuihudi site comprise fragments numbering in the tens
of thousands, with each piece potentially matching any of the others [9]. Second, environmental factors
like moisture and pressure have caused extensive physical deterioration [10, 11], distorting the original
shapes and surfaces. Third, the unique fiber structure of bamboo creates complex fracture patterns that
traditional curve-matching approaches struggle to analyze effectively. These challenges have made the
restoration process highly labor-intensive, with experts sometimes requiring weeks to successfully match
a single pair of fragments [12].

Figure 1: The challenge of bamboo slip rejoining in archaeological research. The excavated
bamboo slip fragments from the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) arranged in a spiral pattern (left) illustrate
the overwhelming scale of the rejoining challenge faced by archaeologists—with thousands of fragments
at single excavation sites, each potentially matching with any other piece. A magnified view of a repre-
sentative fragment (upper right) reveals the characteristic irregular breakage pattern along the fracture
edge, while an example of a reconstructed complete slip (lower right) demonstrates how proper rejoining
establishes textual content continuity, which is essential for the interpretation of ancient texts. The
complex morphology of the fractures, coupled with deterioration from millennia underground, creates a
matching problem of extraordinary complexity that has traditionally required intensive manual effort,
with experts sometimes spending weeks to successfully match a single pair of fragments.
Deep learning for ancient artifact repair
Here we overcome the challenges of fragmented bamboo slip rejoining through physics-driven deep learn-
ing. Our approach integrates principles from the physics of fracture with deep neural networks, enabling
automated matching of fragmented pieces without relying on manually labeled training data. Deep learn-
ing has been successfully used in restoring and attributing ancient texts [13] empowered by large labeled
dataset. While recent years have also seen significant progress in fragmented cultural relic restoration [14]
with labeled data - from oracle bone reconstruction [15, 16, 15, 17] to manuscript fragment matching [6]
- most existing approaches rely on traditional computer vision techniques and struggle with complex
degradation patterns [18]. Some works have attempted to use generative models for cultural heritage
restoration [17]. While achieving promising results, these methods are constrained by the scarcity of
training data and often fail to capture the intricate physical properties of ancient materials [19, 20].
To address these fundamental challenges, we propose WisePanda, a deep learning framework that
leverages physical principles to overcome the data scarcity problem inherent in fragmented bamboo slip
rejoining tasks. Training such a system presents a unique paradox: while manual fragment rejoining is
prohibitively time-consuming - the very problem we aim to solve - this same process would traditionally
be required to generate training data for the model. We resolve this dilemma by resorting to the physics
of fracture [21, 22]. By modeling the physical properties of bamboo and the process that govern its
degradation [23, 10], we generate extensive synthetic training data that captures the essential charac-
teristics of real paired fragment slips (Figure 2). This physics-driven approach enables us to produce
large-scale, realistic training data without requiring manual matching efforts, while ensuring the model
learns meaningful patterns based on actual material properties rather than superficial features.

Data synthesis with physics of fracture
The generation of training data for bamboo slip rejoining requires a comprehensive understanding of
both fracture formation and degradation processes [24]. Our physical model builds on two key observa-
tions: First, bamboo slips exhibit distinct “transverse” and “longitudinal” fracture modes due to their
unique fiber structure [24], as illustrated in Extended Figure E1, with transverse fractures accounting
for approximately 70% of cases. Second, these fractures undergo complex corrosion processes over time,
significantly altering their original patterns [25, 10, 2]. Building on these insights, we develop a system-
atic approach to generate synthetic fragment pairs for transverse fractures, which represent the majority
of rejoining challenges.
The physics of fracture in bamboo slips is governed by their distinctive vertical fiber arrangement [26,
27, 28, 29], as detailed in Extended Figure E2.
When stress extends horizontally across the slip, it
creates characteristic fracture patterns as it propagates through consecutive fiber bundles [30, 27, 29].
We model this process through a probabilistic framework where the fracture angle of each fiber bundle
is influenced by the stress field generated at the fracture endpoint of the preceding fiber bundle. This
physical relationship can be expressed through a probability density function that determines likely
fracture paths based on stress distribution and geometric configurations. The corrosion process is then
simulated by analyzing geometric exposure - protruding areas and exposed surfaces are more susceptible
to degradation through moisture absorption and microorganism activity [31]. To elegantly calculate the
exposure area of each fiber, we ingeniously employ ReLU functions that compare the height differences
between adjacent fibers, effectively capturing only the protruding portions that are more vulnerable to
environmental deterioration. This computational approach allows us to precisely model the progressive
and differential deterioration patterns observed in archaeological samples.
To ensure the generated data accurately reflects real bamboo slip characteristics, we optimize model
parameters using a genetic algorithm [32, 33]. The algorithm evaluates parameter sets by comparing the
distribution of generated fragments against a reference set of 200 real fragment edges through dimension-
ality reduction and Silhouette analysis [34]. Our analysis shows high similarity between the synthetic
and real data distributions. The resulting pipeline enables us to generate extensive training data that
captures both the physical properties of fracture formation and the effects of long-term degradation,
effectively addressing the data scarcity challenge in rejoining fragmented bamboo slips.
WisePanda is a ranking system
WisePanda’s architecture features an interpretable pipeline for fragmented bamboo slip rejoining task
(Figure 3), using synthesized data with physics of fracture for model training and providing top-k candi-
dates to assist archaeologists. At its core lies a TripletNet-based deep learning network [35], designed to
learn effective feature representation that can distinguish between matching and non-matching fragments.
The network processes each input as a 64-dimensional vector that captures the detailed features of the
fracture edge curves [36, 37, 38]. By leveraging a triplet loss function [39, 40, 41], the network learns
to minimize the distance between matching pairs while maximizing the distance between non-matching
ones.
In practical deployment, WisePanda operates by predicting matching probabilities between fragments
and offers archaeologists a ranked list of the top potential matches for each fragment. This significantly
reduces the search space from thousands of candidates to a manageable set [42, 43, 44], thereby stream-
lining the rejoining process. The network’s output is a value between 0 and 1, indicating the model’s
confidence in a match between the input fragments, where a value closer to 1 signifies a higher likeli-
hood of a correct match. Moreover, this ranking approach effectively mitigates the overwhelming task
of manually matching fragments by narrowing down the possibilities to the most probable matches [45].
WisePanda as an archaeologist adjunct
To bridge the gap between computational methods and archaeological research practices, we have de-
veloped an intuitive computer-assisted tool that implements WisePanda’s capabilities in a practical
workflow (Extended Figure E5). When working with this tool, archaeologists first select a target frag-
ment from their collection. The system then automatically generates a ranked list of potential matching
candidates [43, 42, 46], significantly narrowing down the search space from thousands to dozens of frag-
ments. Each suggested match is accompanied by a confidence score derived from WisePanda’s matching
network, allowing archaeologists to prioritize their examination of the most promising candidates.

Figure 3: Framework of WisePanda integrating physics-driven deep learning for bamboo slip
rejoining. The workflow diagram illustrates the complete pipeline of our system. The process begins
with input bamboo slip fragments (top row), where the target fragment is highlighted in pink. In the
physical model stage, we implement two key components: a physics-driven fracture engine that gener-
ates initial breakage patterns, and a corrosion simulation modifier that replicates long-term degradation
effects. The dimensionality reduction module (center) enables comparison between real and synthetic
fragments through statistical visualization techniques, facilitating parameter optimization to ensure re-
alistic fracture simulation. The optimized physical model feeds into the training pair synthesizer, which
generates matching fragment pairs for training the matching network. This matching network learns to
effectively represent and compare fragment features through a multi-layer architecture with specialized
embedding capabilities. During inference (red arrows), the system compares the target fragment against
all candidates, producing a ranked list of potential matches (bottom row).
The ranking transforms
thousands of possible matches into a manageable set, with the system highlighting the most probable
candidates (position 5 shown in pink represents a correct match). This approach enables archaeologists
to focus their verification efforts on the most promising candidates, significantly accelerating the tradi-
tionally time-consuming rejoining process.
The tool provides a dedicated workspace where archaeologists can visually manipulate and compare
fragments through intuitive operations such as dragging, rotating, and fine-tuning alignments. To facil-
itate detailed examination, the system offers specialized visualization features like layer swapping and
edge enhancement, enabling careful inspection of ink traces and fracture patterns All successful matches
are saved and documented in a centralized database, creating a growing repository of verified rejoining
that contributes to the broader restoration effort. This computer-assisted tool has significantly accel-
erated the traditional rejoining workflow [47, 44], ensuring archaeologists maintain full control over the
final verification of matches while benefiting from AI-powered suggestions.
Experimental evaluation
Datasets.
For evaluating WisePanda’s effectiveness, we compiled several datasets of bamboo and
wooden slip fragments. Our primary test set (Bamboo236) consists of 118 pairs of matched bamboo
slip fragments, carefully verified and provided by archaeological experts who successfully rejoined these
fragments through meticulous manual work. These bamboo slip artifacts are part of an ongoing ar-
chaeological research project, with the cultural relics yet to be formally published. To simulate more
5
challenging real-world scenarios, we created an extended dataset (Bamboo1350) by introducing 1114 ad-
ditional interference fragments, expanding the candidate pool to 1,232 total fragments while maintaining
the original test pairs. To assess generalization capabilities across different materials, we also compiled
wooden slip datasets. The base wooden slip test set (Wood670) contains 335 expert-verified pairs, while
its extended version (Wood3833) includes 3163 additional interference fragments. These diverse datasets
enable comprehensive evaluation of fragment matching methods under varying conditions and material
types.
Evaluation methodology. The evaluation process involved computing similarity scores between each
fragment’s fracture edge and all potential matching candidates from the complementary group. Frag-
ments were pre-classified as upper or lower parts, with matching only performed between these distinct
groups. We extracted features from both fracture edges of each fragment, ranked the computed simi-
larity scores, and measured the probability of finding the correct match within the Top-k predictions.
We conducted comprehensive experiments comparing our approach with several existing methods, in-
cluding Manual Random Search, curve matching techniques (using Cosine Similarity and Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)) [48], Fast Matching Method (FMM) [49, 50], and Scale Invariant Signature (SIS) [51].
This comparative framework allows us to assess the relative performance of our physics-driven approach
against established techniques in the field of fragment matching.
Results and analysis. The performance variations among different methods reveal insights about the
nature of the bamboo slip matching problem. In our original test set (Bamboo118), WisePanda demon-
strated superior performance across all metrics, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 12.29%, top-5 accuracy
of 35.17%, top-10 accuracy of 52.54%, top-20 accuracy of 69.07%, and a top-50 accuracy of 94.07%.
Among traditional methods, SIS achieved the second-best performance with a top-1 accuracy of 10.59%
and top-50 accuracy of 72.88%, followed by DTW with a top-50 accuracy of 75.42%. FMM and Cosine
Similarity performed less effectively, with top-50 accuracies of 65.25% and 17.80% respectively.
To simulate real-world archaeological scenarios where numerous unrelated fragments exist, we ex-
panded our test dataset by introducing additional interference fragments. As shown in Extended Fig-
ure E4, when the candidate pool was increased by a factor of approximately 10, WisePanda maintained
a top-50 accuracy of 52.54% compared to the original 94.07%, demonstrating robust performance even
with significantly increased search space.

show Top-k matching accuracy (percentage of correctly identified matches within the top k candidates)
across bamboo and wooden slip datasets.
The original bamboo test set (Bamboo118) contains 118
paired fragments, while the extended version (Bamboo1114) includes 1,114 fragments with additional
interference fragments to create a more challenging matching environment. Similarly, for wooden slips,
we compare performance on the original test set (Wood335) and an extended version (Wood3163). As
demonstrated in Extended Figure E4, WisePanda consistently outperforms traditional curve matching
approaches in both material types and across varying complexity levels, demonstrating the effectiveness
of our physics-driven approach in handling diverse archaeological fragments.

Interpretability of WisePanda
The fundamental challenge in generating training data for bamboo slip matching lies in the irreversible
nature of the physical degradation process [10, 18]. When archaeologists uncover bamboo slip fragments,
they observe only the final degraded edges [7]. The original fracture patterns, which are crucial for
accurate matching, are permanently altered by centuries of degradation and cannot be directly inferred
from the preserved fragments [8, 53]. This irreversibility poses a significant limitation for conventional
data-driven approaches [54, 19, 20, 17], which typically require paired samples of ”before-degradation”
and ”after-degradation” states for effective training, data that is inherently unavailable in archaeological
contexts.
Even generative models like GANs suffer from distribution bias when learning only from
successfully matched fragments, failing to incorporate the underlying physical principles that govern
fracture formation and degradation.
Our physics-driven model addresses this challenge by modeling the forward process of fragmentation
and degradation. We first simulate the initial fracture patterns based on the physics of bamboo fiber
structures [24, 55, 56, 23], then apply physical degradation processes to these patterns. This sequen-
tial modeling captures both the immediate fracture characteristics and their subsequent transformation
through environmental exposure. The physical processes governing bamboo deterioration follow specific
geometric principles, where protruding areas and exposed surfaces are more susceptible to degrada-
tion [10, 18]. By incorporating these physical constraints, WisePanda generates realistic degradation
patterns that closely mirror natural deterioration processes, effectively bridging the gap between the
unknown original fracture patterns and the observed degraded edges.
These physical principles not only enhance the quality of synthetic training data but also provide
interpretability to our WisePanda’s behavior.
The combination of authentic fracture patterns and
physically-based degradation enables WisePanda to capture fundamental characteristics of bamboo slip
fragmentation, generating abundant realistic training data and leading to more robust and generalizable
performance.
Unlike pure data-driven approaches that may overfit to superficial patterns in limited
training samples, our physics-driven model learns meaningful features grounded in the actual physical
processes of fracture and degradation, allowing it to generalize effectively to unseen fragments with
diverse deterioration patterns.
Rejoin fragmented ancient wooden slips
To examine WisePanda’s generalization capability, we applied our approach to wooden slips - another
important medium for ancient text preservation that shares similar characteristics with bamboo slips
but exhibits distinct material properties. While wooden slips served similar documentary purposes, their
different fiber arrangement and material structure present unique challenges for fragment matching [57,
58]. We evaluated our method on a dataset of 335 pairs of wooden slip fragments, following the same
experimental protocol as with bamboo slips.
As shown in Table 1, WisePanda demonstrated promising cross-material generalization with 64.18%
top-50 accuracy on wooden slips. When tested with extended interference fragments in both materials,
performance predictably decreased to 52.54% for bamboo slips (Bamboo1350) and 34.78% for wooden
slips (Wood3833).
This performance difference can be attributed to two key factors. First, the fiber structure of wooden
slips differs substantially from bamboo slips, leading to distinct fracture patterns that deviate from our
physics-driven model’s assumptions [59, 60, 26]. Second, the degradation process varies significantly due
to diverse preservation conditions - factors such as burial duration, soil moisture levels, microbial activity,
and regional soil composition all affect how materials deteriorate over time [61, 62, 63]. Even artifacts
of the same material excavated from different sites or time periods may exhibit varying degradation
patterns, requiring different physical parameters for accurate modeling. These variations are particularly
pronounced when comparing wooden and bamboo materials, as their distinct physical properties interact
differently with environmental factors, leading to material-specific degradation processes that need to be
carefully considered in the modeling approach.
Discussion
In this work, we present WisePanda, the first physics-driven deep learning framework designed for rejoin-
ing fragmented ancient bamboo slips. By incorporating principles from the physics of fracture [64, 65, 27]
into the generation of synthetic training data, our approach overcomes the fundamental challenge of data
scarcity in cultural heritage preservation. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
7
superior matching accuracy and the development of practical tools that are now assisting archaeologists
in their reconstruction work. Our framework’s success in handling both fracture pattern generation and
material degradation simulation highlights the advantage of combining physical principles with deep
learning, particularly in scenarios where traditional data-driven approaches are constrained by limited
training samples.
Beyond its current implementation, this research opens new horizons in bamboo slip reconstruction
and broader cultural heritage preservation [66]. For bamboo slips specifically, our framework can be ex-
tended to handle more complex scenarios by incorporating additional physical parameters that account
for regional variations and different preservation conditions [67, 68]. Furthermore, our approach estab-
lishes a new paradigm for fragment matching where training data is scarce. The methodology can be
adapted to other archaeological materials such as wooden slips, ceramics, metals, and pottery [69, 70, 71],
by modeling their specific physics of fracture and degradation processes. This adaptability stems from
the fundamental nature of our approach while artifacts may vary, the underlying physical principles
governing their fragmentation and degradation remain consistent and modelable [64, 72].
In conclusion, WisePanda represents not merely a technical advancement in bamboo slip rejoining,
but rather a transformative approach to preserving and studying cultural heritage [73]. By combining
physical principles with artificial intelligence, our method provides a robust solution when paired training
data is limited but physical principles are well understood. This synergy of physics and deep learning
opens new possibilities for archaeological fragment matching, potentially revolutionizing how we recover
and interpret artifacts from our past [74, 75].

Figure E1: Typical fracture patterns of ancient bamboo slips. (a), The upper row displays bamboo
samples with transverse fractures, the most common fracture mode (approximately 70%), characterized
by irregular wavy breakage patterns resulting from stress propagating perpendicular to the bamboo fiber
direction. These fractures often have limited text preservation at the fracture edges, with the fragmented
characters providing insufficient information for reliable matching, thus making the morphological fea-
tures of these edges the primary basis for rejoining. (b), The lower row exhibits longitudinal fractures, a
less common but significant fracture mode, characterized by relatively smooth fracture edges that occur
along the bamboo fiber direction. With these smoother fracture patterns, text matching becomes the
primary criterion for correct rejoining, as the physical interlocking features are less pronounced. This
diversity of fracture patterns and preservation states highlights the intrinsic complexity inherent in an-
cient bamboo slip rejoining.

while competing methods fall below 35%, demonstrating physics-driven approach’s advantage in real
archaeological scenarios with thousands of potential matches.
