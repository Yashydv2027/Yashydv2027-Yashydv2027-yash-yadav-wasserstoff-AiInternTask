Abstract 
Keratoconus (KC) is a progressive corneal disorder characterized by localized thinning and protrusion, leading to 
visual distortion. While Placido disc-based topography remains a standard in clinical diagnostics, its dependence on 
specialized equipment limits accessibility. In this paper, we propose a portable, smartphone-based diagnostic 
framework that captures corneal reflections of a Placido disc displayed on a phone screen and applies a two-stage 
detection pipeline, then validate on 3D-printed emulated eyeball models that simulate normal, moderate, and severe 
KC stages based on anterior chamber depth (ACD). The first step of the two-stage detection pipeline is classifying 
different stages of KC with features including height and width of extracted reflections using weighted support vector 
machine (WSVM). It achieves a maximum accuracy of 92.93%, and maintains over 90% accuracy across multiple 
smartphone models, including the Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro. For the second step, we visualize 
the KC-affected protrusion regions on the corneas with color maps based on inter-disc distance, that provides an 
intuitive representation of disease severity and localization. Moreover, we validate the ability of the extracted features 
to differentiate between KC stages with ANOVA and Omega Squared, with significant p-values (e.g., p < 10⁻⁶) and 
large effect sizes (ω² up to 0.8398) among classes.

1. Introduction 
Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal disorder causing blurry and distorted vision from thinning and steepening of the cornea, 
as shown in Figure 1a (Rabinowitz, 1993, 1998). The potential risk factors of KC are corneal thinning and subsequent 
steepening associated with Down syndrome, atopy, eczema, excessive eye rubbing, and genetic disorders (Gordon-
Shaag et al., 2015; Karolak & Gajecka, 2017). Moreover, environmental factors, such as long-lasting ultraviolet light 
exposure and hot climate in some Asian countries such as India, may result in an increase in the number of KC subjects 
compared to other parts of the world (Assiri et al., 2005; Nielsen et al., 2007). 
The most prevalent method for diagnosing KC is monitoring clinical signs such as Vogt striae, Rizzuti signs, Munson 
signs, Fleischer rings, and the retinoscopy scissoring reflex by using slit-lamp examination (Jonas et al., 2009). These 
methods can quickly diagnose moderate to advanced cases of KC. However, the early detection of KC helps to prevent 
vision loss or the need for corneal transplantation, i.e., timely intervention with corneal cross-linking (CXL) can be 
performed before the cornea has thinned excessively, and early detection can help avoid complications associated with 
advanced keratoconus (Belin et al., 2022). To detect mild stages of KC with higher accuracy, a series of corneal 
topography technologies, for instance, Placido disc, photo-keratoscopy, keratometry, and computer-assisted video-
keratography (Bevara & Vaddavalli, 2023; De Sanctis et al., 2007; Gordon-Shaag et al., 2012) have been widely used. 
Scheimpflug imaging, optical coherence tomography, and slit-scan tomography have also been used for KC early 
detection (Buzzonetti et al., 2020). The diagnostic methodologies discussed thus far necessitate using advanced 
clinical devices for data collection. These instruments, however, have limitations in that they could be inconvenient 
and may require a skilled technician for operation and maintenance. Furthermore, for an accurate and reliable 
Keratoconus (KC) diagnosis, ophthalmologists and optometrists should concurrently consider various other clinical 
indicators of the disease (Agrawal, 2011). 
Utilizing advancements in machine learning, image processing technologies, and smartphones' ubiquity, we can now 
develop accurate and easy-to-use imaging and diagnosis methods. For example, the brilliant KC consists of a 3D-
printed Placido disc attachment, an LED light strip, and an intelligent app capturing the reflection of Placido rings 
 
 
3 
 
(Askarian et al., 2018). It utilizes an image processing pipeline to analyze the corneal image and applies the 
smartphone's camera parameters, Placido rings' 3D location, and pixel location of reflected rings for the KC diagnosis 
(Gairola et al., 2021). Another novel feature of our approach is capturing side photos of the eyes, processing these 
images to analyze corneal curvature at various angles, and identifying keratoconus based on the differences observed. 
This method is adaptable to multiple smartphone types with high detection accuracies for severe to moderate 
keratoconus (Askarian et al., 2018). 
Placido-based corneal topography systems project the concentric Placido rings onto the cornea and analyze the 
reflection to assess the anterior corneal surface. (Gao et al., 2020). KC is characterized by localized corneal thinning 
and protrusion, leading to a distinctive distortion of the reflected rings and changes in the inter-ring distance, which 
are regarded as KC hallmarks and a primary diagnostic indicator. While other corneal conditions can influence the 
Placido disc reflection patterns, their effects on inter-ring distances are generally less obvious or perform differently. 
For example, corneal scars and degenerations cause surface irregularities, resulting in localized distortions of the 
reflected rings. However, these distortions are usually limited to the areas of scarring and do not present the 
progressive inter-ring distance changes characteristic of KC (Seitz et al., 1997). An unstable or disrupted tear film can 
affect the quality of Placido disc reflections, leading to artifacts or irregular patterns, but these changes are usually 
diffuse and transient (Fu et al., 2020). In this study, our method is designed to detect the changes from KC. 
In this paper, we propose a portable and easy-to-use methodology for diagnosing Keratoconus (KC). Our method 
leverages smartphones' versatility for detecting KC and image processing and machine learning techniques for 
pinpointing the corneal region affected by the disease. As illustrated in Figure 1b, our procedure does not require a 
3D-printed attachment; instead, we display a Placido disc on the smartphone's screen, directed towards the patient's 
eye, and capture images of the discs reflected from the cornea. This novel approach aids in not only identifying KC 
but also visualizing the affected area of the cornea. Fig 1c shows a broader view of our method where the Placido disc 
is displayed on a smartphone's screen and smartphone's camera then captures images of the reflected discs from aleft 
eye.  We proposed enhanced the Placido disc's design, as shown in Fig 1d-i, where the center ring has been transformed 
into a solid circle to facilitate graphic visualization on the cornea. Fig 1d-ii exhibits’ images obtained from a normal 
cornea, a moderate KC effected cornea and a severe KC effected cornea in our experiments.  We applied an image 
processing pipeline to extract meaningful diagnostic features from the captured images, including specular reflection

removal, disc extraction, and geometric feature measurement (width and height). A two-stage framework was 
employed for KC severity classification and protrusion region visualization after feature extraction. In the first stage, 
we applied multiclass Weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM) to classify the corneas into normal, moderate KC, 
and severe KC categories, achieving a maximum accuracy of 92.93% and maintaining over 90% accuracy across 
multiple smartphone models. In the second stage, we generated color-coded distance maps based on inter-disc 
measurements to visualize KC protrusion's precise location and severity. Statistical analyses, including ANOVA and 
Omega Squared (ω² up to 0.8398), confirmed the effectiveness of the extracted features in distinguishing disease 
stages.

2. Method 
2.1. Design of image capturing model  
Corneal curvature describes how steep (or flat) the surface of the cornea is at a given point. It is typically measured in 
diopters (D) using instruments such as keratometry or Placido-based topographers (Cavas-Martínez et al.; Shirayama 
et al., 2010). For instance, the Keratoconus eyes can be divided into moderate (47.0 to 52.0 D), and severe (52.0 D or 
 
 
5 
 
higher) according to mean curvature (Emre et al., 2007; Hashemi et al., 2020). In topographic systems, increased 
curvature is associated with steeper surfaces, resulting in  compressed or distorted projected rings and reflection 
patterns. In keratoconus corneas, these distortions are localized, especially in inferior or central zones, making 
curvature a critical geometric and diagnostic feature. In order to create amodel fitting the human cornea, we used 
anterior the chamber depth (ACD). As shown in Figure 2, ACD, defined as the distance from the corneal endothelium 
to the anterior lens surface, has been proven to increase with KC severity due to forward displacement of the corneal 
apex (Emre et al., 2007), which allows us to simulate varying KC stages with more anatomical fidelity physically.

Keratoconus. 
In this study, we designed and printed emulated eyeballs for each type of eye: 1) normal, 2) moderate KC, and 3) 
severe KC, based on ACD, using a 3D printer as shown in Table 1. Considering the variety of real eyeballs, we 
designed three versions (smaller, medium, and larger) for each stage of KC (Hashemi et al., 2020; Kovács et al., 2010).

and large) and stages (normal, moderate KC, and severe KC) of Keratoconus. 
In corneal topography, particularly with Placido disc systems, the cornea's anterior surface acts as a convex mirror, 
reflecting light to the imaging system. This method primarily captures the shape and curvature of the cornea by 
analyzing these reflections (Mejía-Barbosa & Malacara-Hernández, 2001; Wang, 2024). In this case, light reflecting 
off the anterior corneal surface is the primary measurement. To quantify when internal refraction can be ignored, we 
considered the geometry of the system, according to Snell's Law as shown in Eq. 1 (Næser et al., 2016): 
𝑛1 sin(𝜃1) = 𝑛2sin⁡(𝜃2)                                                                   (1) 
where 𝑛1 and 𝑛2 are refractive indexes of the first and second medium (air: 𝑛1 ≈1.000, cornea 𝑛2 ≈1.376), 𝜃1 and 
𝜃2 represent the angle of incidence and refraction. In the case of corneal topography, the light rays strike the cornea 
nearly perpendicularly. Since the sine of the angle is approximately equal to the angle itself when measured in radians 
(sin(𝜃) ≈𝜃) for small angles, we could obtain the difference between 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 is minimal by applying this 
approximation in Eq. 2: 
𝑛1𝜃1 ≈𝑛2𝜃2                                                                                  (2) 
In addition, optical path length (OPL) within the cornea is the actual distance light travels inside the cornea (Farjo et 
al., 2009), which is given in Eq. 3: 
𝑂𝑃𝐿= 𝑛2 × 𝑑                                                                                  (3) 
where 𝑑 represents physical thickness of the cornea (0.5 mm centrally), 𝑛2 is the refractive index of the cornea which 
gives an approximate OPL value of 0.688mm. 
By applying Snell's Law and considering the small-angle approximation along with the optical path length within the 
cornea relative to the observation distance, we can justify that the effects of light refraction within the cornea are 
 
 
7 
 
negligible in setups where the light source and camera are positioned significantly farther from the cornea (150 mm) 
than the cornea's thickness. 
Since the standard 3D printing materials used for the eyeball models lack reflective properties, we applied a reflective 
coating to the corneal region of each eyeball model. This simulates the reflective behavior of the anterior corneal 
surface, ensuring that the corneal region has the necessary reflectivity to capture Placido disc patterns. 
In our experimental setup, we modified the camera positioning compared to traditional diagnostic methods, as 
illustrated in Figure 3a. Instead of aligning the camera and light source along the same optical axis, we positioned the 
camera at a 90-degree angle relative to the light source to better capture the reflected Placido disc patterns. While a 
foldable smartphone could theoretically integrate both functions displaying the Placido disc and capturing its reflection 
on separate screens - our implementation utilized two separate smartphones: one serving as the light source and the 
other functioning as the imaging device. This configuration ensures flexibility, enabling the method to be implemented 
using any standard smartphone setup rather than relying on foldable devices. In Figure 3a, the cornea curve C faces 
the light source plane 𝑃𝐺, we capture the images at the plane 𝑃𝐶 which is perpendicular to 𝑃𝐺steps away from the 
conventional same-axis method, 3b, where the camera locates on 𝑃𝐺 and the face’s center of C. The experimental 
setting of 𝑃𝐶 and 𝑃𝐺 is shown in Figure 3c, the green line represents the camera 𝑃𝐶 and the blue line represents the 
Placido disc displaying screen 𝑃𝐺. The various notations in Figures 3a and 3b have specific implications, which will 
be clarified in the following discussion. A and B correspond to any two different circles (ignore the width of the 
circles), 𝐴′and 𝐵′ are the points of incidence from the incident rays 𝐴𝐴′and 𝐵𝐵′. Correspondingly, 𝐴′𝐴′′ and 𝐵′𝐵′′ 
are the reflected rays from cornea model to the plane of camera, 𝐴′′ and 𝐵′′ are the images of corresponding circle we 
obtain from the camera which means the length of the line 𝐴′′𝐵′′ (𝑑′′) is the distance between the two corresponding 
circles observed on camera. Based on the schematic diagram of image capturing, we hypothesize the distance (𝑑′′) 
that Placido discs are related to the severity of Keratoconus, as shown in Eq. 4. 
𝑑′′ = (ℎ𝐵′ −ℎ𝐴′) + 𝑙(𝑡𝑎𝑛2𝛼−
1
𝑡𝑎𝑛2𝛽 ) + 𝑑𝑡𝑎𝑛2𝛼 
(4) 
where ℎ𝐵′ and ℎ𝐴′ represent the distance between the points of incidence 𝐴′ and 𝐵′ and the screen of smartphone’s 
plane 𝑃𝐺, 𝑙 represents the distance between camera’s plane 𝑃𝐶 and outer circle B, d represents the distance between 
the two circles, α and β represent the tangent angles of cornea model at point 𝐴′ and 𝐵′. The equation establishes that 
 
 
8 
 
the distance between any pair of circles-whether adjacent or not-is only determined by the difference in the distances 
between the points of incidence and the smartphone screen's plane, in conjunction with the tangent angles of the cornea 
model at these points of incidence. For those corneas with KC, both factors above - the difference in distances and the 
tangent angles - exhibit an increase. 
The flowchart of our proposed diagnosis model and simultaneous experiment setup is illustrated in Figure 3c. In the 
first step of image collection, we designed and 3D-printed anatomically inspired eyeball models using the Bambu Lab 
X1 Carbon printer (Lab). These models incorporated variations in anterior chamber depth (ACD) to simulate different 
stages of keratoconus (normal, moderate, and severe). A custom L-shaped 3D-printed fixture was used to maintain a 
fixed 15 cm working distance and a consistent imaging angle between the corneal model and the light source. To 
minimize ambient reflections, the interior surfaces of the fixture were coated with black pigment. A Samsung Galaxy 
Note 20 Ultra (Samsung, 2020), with a peak screen brightness of 1500 nits, served as the light source and was 
positioned securely at the base of the setup. The smartphone cameras (iPhone XS MAX (Apple, 2023), iPhone 15 Pro 
(Apple, 2024a), iPhone 16 Pro (Apple, 2024b), and Galaxy Z Flip 3 (Samsung)) were used individually in the second 
step of image collection to capture raw Placido disc reflections from the corneal surface. Images were acquired under 
consistent exposure settings (3 seconds) and with auto-processing enabled. A total of 195 images were collected across 
devices and disease stages. In the third step, we applied reflection detection and image preprocessing algorithms to 
extract the Placido disc patterns from the side-view corneal reflections. These extracted features were then analyzed 
and classified into normal, moderate KC, and severe KC groups, and color-coded visualizations were generated to 
assist with diagnostic interpretation and visualization.

2.2. Data preparation and preprocessing 
We used the Bambu Lab X1 Carbon 3D printer (Lab) to print the emulated eyeballs. This printer features a maximum 
build volume of 256 × 256 × 256 mm³, allowing for the creation of models across our specified size range. We 
employed a 0.4 mm hardened steel nozzle and used Bambu PLA Basic filament with a diameter of 1.75 mm ± 0.03 
mm, ensuring consistent extrusion and structural integrity. The enclosed building chamber, equipped with an activated 
carbon air filter, provided a stable printing environment, minimizing external influences on print quality. To emulate 
the reflective properties of the human cornea, we applied a reflective coating to the corneal region of each 3D-printed 
eyeball model (normal, moderate KC, and severe KC from top to bottom), as shown in Figure 4a. This approach 
effectively simulated the corneal reflection necessary for accurate analysis. In Figure 4b, we illustrate the L-shape 
instrument assisting image collection, which includes one round groove for fixing eyeball models and one holder for 
fixing the smartphone used as light source, and Figure 4c demonstrates the collected images from the eyeball models 
with different stage of KC.

We also designed a 5-circled Placido disc image that improves from the Placido discs of a keratoscope used in the 
optical clinic, as shown in Figure 1d-i. To validate the cross-device generalizability of our proposed method, we 
selected four commercially available smartphones with diverse hardware characteristics: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, 
iPhone XS MAX, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro, as shown in Table 2. They have a fixed working distance of 15 
cm to standardize reflection geometry. These devices represent a range of camera sensor configurations, lens types, 
and image optimization capabilities. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro are equipped with triple-lens systems 
 
 
11 
 
(including ultra-wide and telephotos), macro photography support, and advanced image processing for low-light 
conditions. Compared with them, the iPhone XS MAX and Galaxy Z Flip 3 have more limited camera arrays and lack 
macro functionality. All devices were used with the default camera application, fixed exposure settings (3 seconds), 
and auto-processing enabled to simulate practical deployment scenarios. Additionally, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra—
with a peak screen brightness of 1500 nits—was employed solely as the light source in the image acquisition setup.

proposed Keratoconus diagnostic system. 
We applied specular reflection detection and removal to improve image quality by reducing the specular reflections 
in Placido disc images (Nie et al., 2023). In this study, we conducted imaging in a darkened room with an ambient 
illuminance of 7 lux, simulating the conditions commonly used in ophthalmic clinics. Initially, the system classifies 
the image based on brightness levels to identify regions with specular reflections. An adaptive threshold function, 
responsive to the image's brightness, is then applied to detect these reflective areas accurately. Once identified, the 
specular regions are restored using an exemplary-based inpainting algorithm, which reconstructs the occluded corneal 
features by referencing the surrounding texture information. This approach ensures that the Placido disc reflection 
patterns are accurately represented, enhancing the reliability of corneal curvature assessments. 
For reflection extraction, we firstly applied a decision tree classification algorithm (Breiman, 2017) to extract the 
reflected Placido rings from the corneal images, due to the distinct color characteristics of the ring patterns (i.e., red 
hue relative to the background). Given the consistency and uniqueness of this color feature, we manually selected 
color-related features color-based features including HSV components, and normalized RGB values from the image 
pixels (Li et al.). These features capture hue, saturation, and chromaticity variations, effectively differentiating 
reflection patterns from surrounding non-informative regions. For example, we defined the input feature vector for 
each pixel as: 
 
 
13 
 
[𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙H, 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙S, 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙V,
𝑅
𝑅+ 𝐵+ 𝐺,
𝐺
𝑅+ 𝐵+ 𝐺, 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑎] 
(5) 
where 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙H, 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙S, and 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙V represent the pixel values in HSV color space (Sobottka & Pitas, 1996), R, G, B 
values are the pixel values at R, G, B channels of the images. 
The decision tree algorithm operates by recursively partitioning the feature space based on threshold values learned 
during training. Each node in the tree represents a decision rule based on one feature, and the leaf nodes correspond 
to class labels indicating whether the pixel belongs to a reflected ring or background. Then, we retained the pixels that 
were predicted at the Placido graphic by the classification tree and generated a binary image. 
Secondly, we applied an open-close operation (Soille, 1999) to denoise. Variance in the surface curvature of the cornea 
model can result in uneven light reflection (Urone & Hinrichs, 2016). Specifically, areas with more significant 
curvature tend to capture more light, appearing brighter in images (Healey & Kondepudy, 1994). Furthermore, the 
smartphone, which displays the 8-circle Placido disc, is the light source. As a result, areas closer to this light source 
also exhibit increased brightness.  
Additionally, inherent noise in the camera sensor can contribute to disparities in the captured image. These factors 
collectively lead to color distortions in the original photos, which can interfere with binarization. To minimize the 
impact of color distortions, we applied an opening-closing operation (Soille, 1999). It is a morphological operation to 
reduce noise and enhance objects of interest. The opening operation is an erosion operation followed by dilation. It 
helps to remove small white objects not belonging to Placido circles in the binary image and smooth the boundary of 
the larger objects (Urone & Hinrichs, 2016). The closing operation is dilation followed by erosion. It helps to fill small 
holes and connect slightly disconnected objects. 
Thirdly, we corrected the orientation (Lee et al., 2017) of the denoised image for further analysis. The processed binary 
image visualized the enhanced Placido rings, which included a central ellipse and a series of arcs. We located all the 
connected components in the image and found the central ellipse by identifying the element with white pixels in the 
central bottom area. The orientation, determined by the angle between the x-axis and the ellipse's central axis, was 
used to rotate the entire image and perform further analysis. 
 
 
14 
 
The final step is to focus on the region of interest by removing the irrelevant parts of the image. The bounding boxes 
(Lempitsky et al., 2009) of the ellipse and arcs define a rectangle for cropping. 
A total of 232 images were collected across four smartphone models, encompassing three categories: normal, moderate 
keratoconus (KC), and severe KC. The dataset includes 42 images from the Galaxy Z Flip 3, 65 from the iPhone XS 
MAX, 58 from the iPhone 15 Pro, and 67 from the iPhone 16 Pro as shown in Table 3.

2.3. Weighted support vector machines 
To classify corneal images into three categories: 1) normal, 2) moderate KC, and 3) severe KC, we employed a 
multiclass Weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM) classifier (Yang et al., 2007). This approach efficiently 
handles class imbalances by assigning different weights to each class, thereby reducing the influence of 
underrepresented categories on the decision boundary. WSVM aims to find optimal hyperplanes that maximize the 
margin between classes while incorporating class-specific weights into its optimization problem. The optimization 
problem for WSVM is formulated in Eq. 6: 
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒⁡𝜙(𝑤) = 1
2 𝑤𝑇𝑤+ 𝐶∑𝑊𝑖𝜉𝑖 
(6) 
subject to: 
𝑦𝑖(〈𝑤, 𝜙(𝑥𝑖)〉+ 𝑏) ≥1 −𝜉𝑖, 𝑖= 1, … , 𝑙;⁡𝜉𝑖≥0, 𝑖= 1, … , 𝑙 
(7) 
where 𝑥𝑖𝜖ℝ𝑑 represents feature vector (i.e. width and height measurements from the Placido disc images), 
𝑦𝑖𝜖{−1,0,1} is the class labels correspond to normal, moderate KC, and severe KC respectively, 𝑤 and 𝑏 define the 
hyperplane, 𝜉𝑖 are slack variables allowing for misclassification, 𝐶 is the regularization parameter controlling the 
 
 
15 
 
trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error, and 𝑤𝑖 are the weights assigned to 
each sample based on class distribution. 
To extend the binary WSVM to multiclass classification, we applied the one-vs-one (OvO) strategy (Milgram et al., 
2006), constructing a WSVM classifier for each pair of classes. A majority voting among all pairwise classifiers 
determine the final classification decision for a new sample. This method allows for fine-tuned decision boundaries 
sensitive to each class's characteristics. 
However, they are sensitive to outliers, as these anomalous data points can significantly influence the position of the 
decision boundary, leading to reduced model performance. To reduce this effect, we applied Z-score normalization 
to the feature set to standardize the data, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations 
within the SVM algorithm. This preprocessing step enhances the model's performance by preventing larger-scale 
features from dominating the learning process and reducing the effect of outliers. The Z-score for a data point 𝑥 is 
calculated in Eq. 8: 
𝑍= 𝑥−𝜇
𝜎
 
(7) 
where 𝜇 represents the mean value, and 𝜎 is the standard deviation of the dataset. Data points with a Z-score 
exceeding a certain threshold (±3) are considered outliers and can be excluded from the dataset. Removing these 
outliers makes the dataset allow the SVM to establish a more accurate decision boundary and reduces the influence 
of extreme values on the model's performance. 
2.4. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
To evaluate whether there are statistically significant differences among the means of three independent groups—namely, 
normal, moderate keratoconus (KC), and severe KC—we employed a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (Quirk 
& Quirk, 2012). This method is appropriate for comparing more than two group means and helps control the Type I error 
rate that would increase if multiple pairwise t-tests were conducted. ANOVA partitions the total variability in the data 
into variability between groups and within groups, allowing us to assess whether the between-group variability is 
significantly greater than what would be expected by chance. The test statistic for ANOVA is the F-ratio, calculated as: 
 
 
16 
 
𝐹= 𝑀𝑆𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛
𝑀𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛
 
(5) 
where 𝑀𝑆𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 is the mean square between groups, and 𝑀𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛 is the mean square within groups. A significant F-
ratio indicates that at least one group means differs from the others, warranting further post hoc analyses to identify 
specific group differences.  
2.5. Omega Squared (ω²) 
While ANOVA determines the presence of statistically significant differences among group means, it does not convey 
the magnitude of these differences. To quantify the proportion of variance in the dependent variable attributable to group 
membership, we calculated omega squared (𝜔2), an effect size measure. Omega squared is preferred over eta squared 
(𝜂2) because it provides a less biased estimate of the population effect size, particularly in studies with small sample 
sizes. The formula for omega squared in a one-way ANOVA is: 
𝜔2 = 𝑆𝑆𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛−(𝑑𝑓𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛× 𝑀𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛)
𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙+ 𝑀𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛
 
(7) 
 
where 𝑆𝑆𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 is the sum of squares between groups, 𝑑𝑓𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 is the degrees of freedom between groups, 𝑀𝑆𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛 
is the mean square within groups, and 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 is the total sum of squares. Omega squared values range from 0 to 
1, with higher values indicating a greater proportion of variance explained by the group variable. This measure 
provides a more accurate reflection of the effect size in the population, enhancing the interpretability of our findings. 
3. Results 
3.1. Image preprocessing 
In this paper, we applied a robust approach to extract reflected Placido discs as the diagram shown in Figure 5. We 
visually compare the original corneal image captured by the smartphone camera and the processed image after specular 
reflection detection and removal. In the original image (Figure 5a), obvious specular highlights are observed on the cornea 
model, which is caused by the reflection of the environment illumination source. These reflections can be detected in 
further image processing, potentially affecting the accuracy of analysis. After applying a brightness-based detection and 
exemplar-based inpainting method, the specular highlights were suppressed in the processed image (Figure 5b), and they 
 
 
17 
 
became smoother and gentler. This improvement enhances and contributes to more reliable feature extraction for 
keratoconus classification.

3.2. Two-stage KC diagnosis – Classification 
To evaluate the robustness and generalizability of our proposed method, we assessed performance across corneal 
images captured by different smartphone cameras: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone XS MAX, iPhone 15 Pro, and 
iPhone 16 Pro, as shown in Figure 6 (a–d). Across all devices except iPhone XS MAX, the classifier achieved high 
specificity and sensitivity, particularly in identifying severe KC cases. This consistency suggests the model’s ability 
 
 
18 
 
to recognize morphological changes associated with severe KC, regardless of imaging source. Confusion was 
occasionally observed for moderate and normal classes, and different stages, especially in the iPhone XS MAX dataset 
(Figure 5b), where moderate KC was misclassified as severe and normal. This suggests that features at early stages 
may be more susceptible to variations in imaging conditions or reflective artifacts. Compared with the iPhone XS 
MAX, data from the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro had fewer misclassifications, demonstrating the model's 
capability to reduce intra-class variance and camera-dependent noise with more advanced camera specifications.

Besides confusion matrices, we also evaluated the method with standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 
score) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, as shown in Table 3. All image data were acquired under 
controlled conditions with consistent lighting and fixed imaging angles to eliminate environmental variability. Among 
 
 
19 
 
the devices tested, the iPhone 16 Pro achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 92.93% (CI: 0.78–0.99), 
precision of 92.43%, recall of 91.24%, and an F1 score of 90.03%. Similarly, the iPhone 15 Pro showed strong and 
stable performance (accuracy: 91.57%, CI: 0.75–0.99), supporting the effectiveness of our system across advanced 
smartphone models. 
The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 was used solely in its unfolded form as a standard smartphone camera, demonstrating 
an accuracy of 90.04% (CI: 0.70–0.99) and an F1 score of 88.38%. These results establish a practical performance 
threshold, suggesting that any device achieving similar or higher metrics can be considered suitable for this diagnostic 
framework. In contrast, the iPhone XS MAX obtained an accuracy of only 68.95% (CI: 0.00–0.50) and 
correspondingly low scores in other metrics. Based on these findings, we designate the specifications of the Samsung 
Galaxy Z Flip 3 as the reference threshold, and consider devices performing below this baseline as unsuitable for 
clinical deployment within this system. In conclusion, the classification results demonstrate that the proposed system 
maintains high diagnostic accuracy, precision, and robustness across multiple smartphone models with varying 
hardware specifications..

3.3. Two-stage KC diagnosis – Visualization 
Keratoconus causes localized thinning and protrusion of the cornea altering its topography. KC does not appear at a 
fixed location but manifests anywhere on the cornea. Thus, we visualize a distance matrix to pinpoint the exact location 
of the protrusion. This distance map facilitates more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, such as determining 
 
 
20 
 
suitable sites for corneal cross-linking or intracorneal ring segment (ICRS) placement, as performed conventionally 
in Alió’s work (Alió et al., 2006).  
We implemented a color scheme to enhance the interpretability of Keratoconus severity. This visual enhancement 
more effectively differentiates the levels of corneal protrusion, with individual colors indicating diverse depths. It 
allows us to visualize the exact location of KC on the cornea as shown in Figure 7.

Colormap of normal cornea. b) Colormap of moderate KC cornea.  c) Colormap of severe KC cornea. 
Spanning an angular range from 45 to 135 degrees, this visual improvement effectively distinguished varying inter-
disc distances, with the color spectrum representing these distances. More blueish colors, such as blues and greens, 
were assigned to shorter distances, corresponding to healthier cornea states, while warmer hues, including oranges 
and reds, depicted longer distances caused by protrusion, indicating more severe KC conditions. As the colors 
transition from cool to warm, they suggest progression from normal status to severe KC-affected status, with the red 
tones indicating the most severe cases. The color map differentiates among normal and different stages of corneas and 
precisely visualizes the KC on the cornea, making it a valuable tool for accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment 
planning.

3.4. Statistical analysis 
Figure 8 illustrates the standardized width and height feature distribution of each device across keratoconus severity 
levels. In all cases, height decreases by increasing disease severity, supporting its value as a consistent geometric 
marker of disease and its severity. The separation between classes is most distinct in the iPhone 16 Pro (Figure 8d), 
where the interquartile ranges are well-separated with minimal overlap. Conversely, the iPhone XS MAX (Figure 8b) 
exhibits more significant variability and class overlap, particularly in the height feature, which contributes to its lower 
classification performance.

Table 5 summarizes the results of one-way ANOVA and corresponding Omega Squared (ω²) effect sizes for 
standardized width and height measurements across keratoconus severity levels on different smartphone devices. 
Across all devices, height consistently demonstrated stronger discriminatory power than width, with the highest effect 
sizes observed on iPhone XS MAX and iPhone 16 Pro (ω² = 0.8398), indicating that height captures substantial 
variance associated with disease stage. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 also showed large effect sizes for width (ω² = 
0.5435) and height (ω² = 0.3302), confirming its suitability as a performance threshold. In contrast, width 
measurements from iPhone 15 Pro showed no significant group differences (ω² = –0.0212), suggesting that device-
specific optical factors may influence the reliability of certain features.

4. Conclusion 
Placido disc technology and its computer analysis have long been an established method for diagnosing keratoconus. 
However, it requires operator experience and is costly. This manuscript introduces a novel application of Placido disc 
technology using a smartphone platform. We utilize the smartphone camera to capture distinctive corneal images, 
enabling a novel data extraction and analysis approach. 
In our approach, we modified the traditional Placido disc by replacing the empty central ring with a solid circle, 
significantly improving the accuracy and consistency of the extracted reflection. As shown in Figure 3, compared to the 
empty ring design, the solid circle allows for the entire reflected shape to form a well-defined ellipse. This complete 
reflection enables precise orientation correction by detecting the long axis of the reflected shape and rotating it 
accordingly. With a consistently aligned reflection, subsequent feature extraction becomes more reliable. Specifically, 
for distance matrix generation, the rays used to compute inter-disc distances will always originate from a fixed starting 
point, which is the center of the solid reflected ellipse, minimizing the bias in distance measurements compared to the 
fragmented reflections from a traditional Placido disc that is hard to localize the center. Furthermore, when measuring 
the height and width of the extracted Placido disc reflection, the corrected orientation ensures more accurate dimension 
estimation, reducing errors caused by misalignment. This refinement ultimately enhances the overall precision of 
keratoconus classification and visualization. 
In summary, our proposed WSVM-based classification framework demonstrates robust and accurate performance across 
various smartphone cameras, suggesting its potential as a reliable tool for keratoconus severity classification. Our 
 
 
24 
 
proposed method achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores with advanced devices such as the iPhone 15 
Pro, iPhone 16 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3. Particularly, the classifier can reliably detect severe KC cases across 
all tested devices, indicating its sensitivity to the morphological changes associated with advanced disease stages. 
By setting the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 as a practical baseline threshold, we propose a baseline to evaluate smartphone 
suitability in clinical diagnostic contexts. Devices that exceed this performance threshold, such as the iPhone 15 Pro and 
iPhone 16 Pro, were shown to be well-suited for accurate KC classification. On the other hand, even if the imaging 
conditions are controlled, the significantly degraded performance observed with the iPhone XS MAX demonstrates that 
hardware or software limitations can reduce the system's reliability. These findings underscore the significance of 
camera quality and reinforce the system's suitability for deployment in portable, cost-effective settings, as device 
specifications meet the required standards. 
Previous studies that rely on conventional Placido disc-based topographers, such as the work by Kamiya et al. (Kamiya 
et al., 2021)., which used TMS-4TM equipment and deep learning on color-coded topography maps to achieve high 
classification accuracy (96.6%) and sensitivity (98.8%) for keratoconus detection, and 78.5% accuracy in classifying 
the stage. While traditional systems require costly, stationary clinical instrumentation and specialized acquisition 
software, our smartphone-based system captures raw reflection patterns directly from the cornea using readily 
available consumer devices under controlled but portable conditions. Despite using simplified imaging inputs without 
full surface curvature reconstruction, our approach achieves comparable classification performance, with the added 
advantage of enabling point-of-care deployment and broader accessibility in low-resource or non-clinical settings. 
Based on the comparative evaluation, we suggest using the hardware and imaging performance of the Samsung Galaxy 
Z Fold 3 as a minimum threshold for clinical applicability to ensure reliable diagnostic outcomes. This device features 
a dual-camera system with a 12MP main lens (27 mm, f/1.8) and a 12MP ultra-wide lens (14 mm, f/2.2), along with 
night mode support (3-second exposure) and automatic processing for low-light environments. The classifier achieved 
over 90% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.38%, with images captured using this setup under consistent acquisition 
protocols. Devices lacking key capabilities such as macro photography support or advanced computational 
enhancement, like the iPhone XS MAX, exhibited substantially poorer performance (accuracy: 16.48%, F1 score: 
11.60%) under the same imaging conditions. 
 
 
25 
 
In addition to classification performance, statistical analyses were conducted to validate the reliability and discriminative 
strength of the extracted features. One-way ANOVA and Omega Squared (ω²) confirmed that the height feature exhibited 
large effect sizes across most devices, particularly for the iPhone 16 Pro (ω² = 0.8398), indicating a strong association 
with KC severity. Furthermore, classification metrics were evaluated using a 1,000-iteration bootstrapping approach, 
yielding narrow 95% confidence intervals for high-performing devices, such as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro. 
These results affirm the robustness of the proposed features and support the statistical reliability of the system's diagnostic 
performance across various device configurations. 
Our comprehensive analysis helped distinguish normal corneas from those suffering from Keratoconus, recognize 
different stages of the cornea, and provide the location of the KC. A noteworthy addition was the inclusion of a color 
map in the distance matrix, which improved the precise visualization of KC on the cornea and enhanced diagnostic 
accuracy. This innovative technique can refine treatment strategies by providing a clear visualization of the affected 
areas. Due to widespread use of smartphones, our approach facilitates access to advanced diagnostic tools, making them 
available to a broader audience, including those in remote or underserved areas. It enables rapid and convenient 
preliminary screening for keratoconus, eliminating the need for specialized equipment or trained personnel. In future 
work, we plan to conduct comprehensive clinical trials to assess the efficacy and accuracy of our diagnostic method. This 
will include gathering data from patients with different severities of keratoconus and exploring the integration of 
additional diagnostic modalities, such as corneal biomechanics and tomography, to ensure the model’s robustness and 
reliability in real-world applications.
