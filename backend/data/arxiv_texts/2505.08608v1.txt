Abstract 
Single-molecule fluorescence assays enable high-resolution analysis of biomolecular dynamics, but traditional 
analysis pipelines are labor-intensive and rely on users’ experience, limiting scalability and reproducibility. Recent deep 
learning models have automated aspects of data processing, yet many still require manual thresholds, complex architectures, 
or extensive labeled data. Therefore, we present DASH, a fully streamlined architecture for trace classification, state 
assignment, and automatic sorting that requires no user input. DASH demonstrates robust performance across users and 
experimental conditions both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems such as Cas12a-mediated DNA cleavage. This 
paper proposes a novel strategy for the automatic and detailed sorting of single-molecule fluorescence events. The dynamic 
cleavage process of Cas12a is used as an example to provide a comprehensive analysis. This approach is crucial for 
studying biokinetic structural changes at the single-molecule level.  
Introduction 
Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a leading technique for the study of biomolecular 
dynamics and interactions at the nanoscale. In the FRET process, energy is transferred1,2 between two fluorophores (light-
emitting molecules) when they are close enough together (in nanometers)3. This process depends on how close the 
fluorophores are. By overcoming the limitations of traditional ensemble FRET measurements, which often obscure critical 
molecular details due to population averaging, single-molecule FRET provides unprecedented insights into conformational 
changes and interaction dynamics. It also enables researchers to observe real-time structural dynamics4 and interactions 
that remain elusive in ensemble measurements. The versatility of single-molecule FRET is evident across various 
applications in biophysics and molecular biology, including the study of conformational dynamics of proteins and nucleic 
acids 4,5, such as the ribosome6–9, Cas proteins10–13, membrane proteins14–18, chromatin19, RNA riboswitches20,21, elucidation 
of biomolecular interactions22. 
A typical single-molecule FRET data analysis involves region alignment, point spread function identification, 
fluorescence intensities of donor and acceptor fluorophores measurement, trace classification, and state assignment for 
subsequent kinetic quantification. Extracting kinetic parameters and recognizing distinct FRET states from single-molecule 
FRET data can be challenging due to experimental limitations and the inherent complexity of biomolecular dynamics. 
Current methods developed to address these challenges can be broadly categorized into Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-
based approaches23–26 and deep learning approaches27–29. HMMs are employed to infer the state-to-state transitions s, which 
is robust for noisy data and complex kinetic schemes, but HMMs assume that single-molecule events occur on slower 
timescales than those of data acquisition, which may not always be true, and always required input number of states. Deep 
learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)30 and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)31 have become 
pervasive. These models accelerate single-molecule fluorescence events analysis by handling large and complex datasets 
 2 / 15 
 
effectively and automatically. However, it should be noted that current analytical methods all rely to a certain extent on 
some input or judgment by users during the analysis process, which can lead to a biased selection of single-molecule 
fluorescence events and affect the conclusions drawn. 
To address these limitations, we introduce DASH (Deep learning-based Automatic Sorting by identifying Hidden 
states in fluorescence events), a deep learning framework designed to automatically sort fluorescence events while 
eliminating user-dependent biases. DASH integrates two modules: trace classification and state assignment of single-
molecule fluorescence events, offering a simplified architecture that reduces model complexity and training overhead. 
Importantly, DASH segments events and assigns discrete FRET states without the need for user-defined thresholds or 
manual specification of the number of states. This fully automated workflow minimizes user dependence and enhances 
reproducibility across different expertise levels, helping the user to have a more comprehensive understanding of the 
experimental system in the absence of a priori knowledge. Here, we validate the performance of DASH through the use of 
three equilibrium systems (Ribosome32, β2 adrenergic receptor33 and Holliday junction34) and two non-equilibrium systems 
(Cas12a35 and CasX (also known as Cas12e)36), the results of further analysis based on trace classification and state 
assignment results all show a high consistency with existing knowledge. 
Results 
DASH training and validation 
DASH can be divided into two stages, trace classification, and state assignment (Figure 1a).  
Trace classification: The model for trace classification is trained based on five datasets from three distinct biological 
samples: the ribosome 32, the β2 adrenergic receptor 33, and the DNA Holliday Junction 34. These include triple-classification 
labels, which were manually annotated by human experts and DASH, please see our previous study for details of 
classification rules37. The trace classification adopts bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) network and is 
equipped with CRF (conditional random field). Bi-LSTM networks are well-suited for handling temporal dependencies in 
sequential data, such as FRET traces. They can capture both forward and backward dependencies in an auto-aggressive 
manner, which can effectively process the time-ordered nature of FRET traces, distinguishing between different states 
based on intensity fluctuations. CRF layers are particularly applied to utilize the embeddings from bi-LSTM and modeling 
state transitions and dependencies between labels. In FRET analysis, CRFs can help identify the sequence of molecular 
states by considering the probabilities of transitioning between these states. By optimizing the transition matrix and 
calculating the whole sentence likelihood, CRFs ensure that the predicted state sequence is globally optimal, considering 
the dependencies between adjacent states. This is essential for accurately capturing kinetic information from FRET traces. 
The combination of bi-LSTM and CRF is to use bi-LSTM networks to extract robust features from the intensity traces 
and use CRFs to further refine these features by imposing constraints on the sequence of states, helping to distinguish true 
state transitions from noise-induced fluctuations. For this stage, the input is the raw two-color trace signals from single-
molecule two-color fluorescence experiments, the output is a three-class category, ‘donor photobleached’, ‘acceptor 
photobleached’, and ‘discarded’. (Figure 1b, Supplementary Figure S1). 
Compared to manually classified results, Deep HSM achieves an average F1 score of 0.91 (Figure 1c) on five datasets, 
the model, indicating that the model performs comparably to that of human experts. The consistency between classifications 
from two independent experts was approximately 0.937. Furthermore, the high consistency of the identification of FRET 
events demonstrates the model's suitability for determining the appropriate segmentation timepoint (Figure 1d).  
State Assignment: As for the second stage, considering the lack of a priori knowledge of most of the experimental 
data, we choose to use the HMM to assign discrete states for trace segments obtained in stage 1. The assumption in HMM 
naturally aligns with FRET traces which capture time-dependent molecular conformational changes: Discrete hidden states 
correspond to distinct molecular configurations (low/mid/high FRET efficiencies). Observed emissions (fluorescence 
intensities) depend probabilistically on these hidden states. Markovian transitions between states model kinetics (e.g., 
 3 / 15 
 
binding/unbinding events or structural rearrangements). The FRET of single experiments is concated and estimated by 
HMM to determine the optimal number of discrete states, which is decided by a weighted score of BIC and silhouette score. 
Only FRET traces classified as ‘donor photobleached’ or ‘acceptor photobleached’ proceed to the second stage of analysis. 
HMMs are employed to model the observed fluorescence intensities as emissions from discrete hidden states, enabling the 
identification of distinct FRET states. The output of this stage includes inferred state trajectories, which represent the most 
likely sequence of hidden states over time. Additionally, frequent events are identified through frequency counts of state 
transitions, providing insights into the dynamics of molecular interactions. This approach ensures state assignment and 
facilitates the extraction of key kinetic and structural information from single-molecule FRET traces. 
 
Accurate FRET states assignment in steady two-color traces. 
Based on the results from DASH's state assignment for the five datasets, we can obtain the FRET distribution results 
for different states. The model demonstrates the ability to accurately assign FRET states that are very close to each other, 
as well as those that account for a small percentage of the total (Figure 2a). The FRET distribution plots based on the 
DASH’s trace classification and state assignment results are consistent with the results of our previous paper37, which also 
proves the accuracy of DASH in trace classification and state assignment. Furthermore, traces can be finely sorted 
automatically according to distinct FRET patterns (see categorized FRET distributions and traces in Supplementary Figures 
S2-S6). Here, we define a pattern as the occurrence of a FRET state transfer within the current trace and the direction of 
that state transfer, which considers both the number of states and the state-to-state transitions direction. 
Additionally, based on the state assignment results, we can quantify the proportion of state transition times across all 
traces (Figure 2b). These results provide users with a preliminary understanding of whether the experimental data exhibit 
static FRET or transient FRET. For example, the Holliday Junction shows a transition between two FRET states under 
high salt conditions (500 mM Mg²⁺). Conversely, under low salt conditions (1 mM Mg²⁺), the dynamics are accelerated 
beyond the camera's set time resolution, leading to an average representation of the two states and resulting in most traces 
exhibiting one FRET state. For transient traces, the state-to-state transition direction and probability show the dynamic 
changes of traces (Figure 2c). Please refer to Supplementary Tables 1-5 for all patterns sorted automatically after the DASH 
analysis. In summary, the automatic sorting method offers an intuitive understanding of the FRET states, the percentage of 
different states, and the transitions between states. 
Automatic sorting based on DASH classification following the state assignment of AsCas12a.  
DASH's state assignment-based automatic clustering enhances its performance in analyzing non-equilibrium dynamic 
systems, particularly in the context of single-molecule FRET experiments where fluorescence signals appear during data 
acquisition and exhibit transient states. Non-equilibrium dynamics are inherent in many biological processes, including 
ribosome initiation and elongation32, β2-adrenergic receptor signaling33, and Cas protein target recognition and 
cleavage13,35,36. Analyzing these processes demands tools capable of capturing fluorescence events, inferring state 
transitions, and detecting FRET time-dependent changes in population distributions. 
 In this study, we reanalyze data from previously published Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a (AsCas12a) recognition and 
cleavage design35,37. AsCas12a can be guided by crRNA to recognize DNA target sites adjacent to PAM sites to initiate R-
loop formation and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage. Utilizing single-molecule FRET, we observed the 
interactions between Cy3-labeled Cas12a/crRNA complexes and immobilized Cy5-labeled DNA, allowing to sequentially 
capture the formation of the Cas12a/crRNA/DNA complex, non-target strand (NTS) cleavage, target strand (TS) cleavage, 
and DNA fragment release (Figure 3a). 
To illustrate the DASH-based data analysis process, a case study is presented using the AsCas12a cleavage assay with 
a fully matched DNA target. In the trace classification stage, DASH classifies long-term intensity-frame fluorescence traces 
and selected fluorescence event segments, accurately determining their start and end time points (Figure 3b). Subsequently, 
the selected segments for "donor photobleaching" and "acceptor photobleaching" are automatically processed in stage 2 
for FRET state assignment. Based on the state assignment results of all selected segments, we generated time-dependent 
 4 / 15 
 
FRET probability density plots (Figure 3c) by synchronizing all identified events at the initiation or termination time points 
of the FRET signals. From these plots, As0MM exhibits a total of five states, with States 1 to 4 (S1-S4) sequentially 
corresponding to the initial R-loop formation, NTS cleavage, and TS cleavage. Notably, State 0 (S0) has a FRET value 
close to 0, indicating that the Cy3-labeled Cas12a/crRNA complex searches for immobilized Cy5-labeled target DNA 
through one-dimensional (1D) diffusion. This process is typically short (less than 5 frames) but frequent, suggesting that 
DASH effectively manages complex and transient FRET states. State 2 (S2) occupies the majority of the FRET distribution, 
indicating that most of the Cas12a remains at the R-loop formation step or stays at this step for an extended period (Figure 
3c). The FRET distribution plots based on the DASH classification and state assignment results are consistent with the 
findings of our previous paper35, further validating the accuracy of DASH in trace classification and state assignment. 
To further understand the various steps of the Cas12a cleavage process, we analyzed FRET probability density plots 
over time and the corresponding FRET distributions based on the number of states present within a fluorescence event. 
(Figure 3d). Our analysis showed that the majority of fluorescence events (about 35% of the total) remained in a single 
state, while only 246 fluorescence events (2.48%) out of a total of 3,767 selected events were observed across all four 
cleavage steps of AsCas12a (Figure 3d). Each category with a different number of states can be further categorized by a 
specific pattern that takes into account both the number of states and the state-to-state transitions direction (Figures 3e-3g). 
All fluorescence events can be categorized first by transition number and then by pattern (Figure 3h). All patterns 
automatically categorized after the DASH analysis are shown in Supplementary Table 6. This model-free sorting method 
facilitates quick access for users to the individual categories representing different biological activities. 
Known for its widespread use in genome editing, AsCas12a's activity is affected by mismatches. We attempted to 
introduce mismatches between the crRNA and target DNA for single-molecule FRET assays, utilizing DASH for trace 
classification, state assignment, and automatic sorting. As expected, the introduction of mismatches hinders the transition 
to high FRET cleavage (Figures 4a, 4d, 4g and Supplementary Figure 7) and reduces the proportion of more than four 
transition times (Figures 4b, 4e, 4h). From the subcategorization based on number of states present within an event ((Figures 
4c, 4f, 4i), the events containing all four cleavage steps of AsCas12a decreased to 1.27% (3MM), 2.94% (6MM), and 0.20% 
(7MM). Each category of different number of states within a fluorescence event can be further sorted by specific pattern 
(Supplementary Figures 8-10), all patterns automatically categorized after the DASH analysis are shown in Supplementary 
Tables 7-9. 
In summary, the state assignment results based on DASH provide an effective automatic sorting method that enables 
the identification of a relatively small group of fluorescence events within the majority, without being obscured by the 
average results presented by the whole dataset. 
Automatic sorting based on DASH classification following the state assignment of CasX (Cas12e)  
CasX, also known as Cas12e, is a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system that is smaller in size38 compared to the widely used 
Cas9 and Cas12a, showing considerable promise in genome editing. It specifically recognizes the 5'-TTCN PAM and 
demonstrates significant genome editing efficacy when combined with single guide RNA (sgRNA) in human cells. Two 
homologous proteins, Deltaproteobacteria (DpbCasX) and Plantomycetes (PlmCasX), have been extensively studied39. In 
this study, we collected data from previously published CasX recognition and cleavage designs36, where Cy3 and Cy5 
fluorophores were attached to the 3’ end of sgRNA and the target strand, 34 nucleotides away from the PAM distal end. In 
the trace classification stage, DASH classifies long-term intensity-frame fluorescence traces and selected fluorescence 
events, accurately determining their start and end time points (Figures 5a,5d). Subsequently, the selected segments for 
"donor photobleaching" and "acceptor photobleaching" are automatically processed in stage 2 for FRET state assignment. 
Based on the state assignment results of all selected fluorescence events, three different conformational states of dpbCasX 
during cleavage are revealed: R-loop formation (corresponding to State 1), NTS pre-cleavage (corresponding to State 2), 
and TS pre-cleavage (corresponding to State 3) (Figures 5b-5c and Supplementary Figure 11a). In contrast, plmCasX 
exhibits only two FRET states due to different cleavage steps on the NTS (Figures 5e-5f and Supplementary Figure 11b).

The time-dependent FRET probability density plots obtained through DASH trace classification and state assignment align 
with previous studies36 but with a greater number of identified fluorescence events. Through automatic sorting analysis, 
we found that the majority of fluorescence events remain at the R-loop formation step. Productive binding can be 
effectively separated from all events among numerous datasets, showing consistent time-dependent FRET changes in line 
with previous findings. Each category of different number of states within a fluorescence event can be further sorted by 
specific pattern (Supplementary Figures 12-13), all patterns automatically categorized after the DASH analysis are shown 
in Supplementary Tables 10-11. 
Discussion 
In summary, DASH is a deep learning-based framework for identifying single-molecule fluorescence events by 
integrating trace classification with state assignment. The method segments FRET traces into three categories and assign 
discrete states to selected segments, enabling the detection of diverse transition patterns. It effectively captures both steady 
and dynamically emerging events in two-color traces of varying lengths without relying on any user-defined thresholds. 
To maximize accessibility, we provide open-source Python code for model training, trace classification (emerging events 
identification), and state assignment. Based on the results of DASH's trace classification and state assignment, we can 
automatically generate a further sorting of fluorescence events, which can be refined into specific patterns. This refinement 
takes into account the FRET states exhibited at the single-molecule level, reflecting the number of conformational changes 
as well as the directed transitions between different FRET states. The advantage of this automatic sorting method, grounded 
in state assignment, is that it does not require the experimenter to possess a priori knowledge of the experimental system. 
Instead, it allows for the analysis of each pattern-based category and resolves conclusions or trends that may be obscured 
by massive amounts of data. This approach effectively demonstrates how experimental data can inform and guide the 
interpretation of results, enhancing the understanding of the underlying biological processes. This capability not only 
streamlines the analysis process but also provides a more objective framework for interpreting complex fluorescence data. 
Methods  
Training datasets  
In consideration of the potential variance in fluorescence intensity levels due to different application systems, five 
single-molecule, two-color FRET datasets were collected for trace segmentation network training, using three different 
biological samples: ribosomes, the β2 adrenergic receptor, and DNA Holliday junctions. For each dataset, approximately 
1,500 traces were manually classified by two experts, including start and photobleaching points. Details of the experiments 
and system illustrations were provided in our previous study37. 
Network training  
Our model consists of an embedding layer, a BiLSTM, a Conditional Random Field (CRF), and an HMM layer, 
arranged sequentially as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The input two-color fluorescence trace is first processed through the model, 
and frame-wise labels are predicted by the CRF layer. Based on these predicted labels, we extract segments annotated as 
donor-photobleached or acceptor-photobleached and feed them into the HMM layer to infer discrete hidden states. After 
state assignment, we analyze the state transition patterns within these segments—for example, transitions from state 0 to 
state 1—and identify representative patterns characteristic of the experimental condition. 
In stage one, the neural network was constructed using the PyTorch framework and executed on a single NVIDIA 
3090 Ti GPU. The architecture includes a bi-LSTM-CRF layer, as illustrated in Figure 1(a), consisting of three bi-LSTM 
layers with a hidden dimension of 32, followed by a CRF layer. During training, a dropout rate of 0.2 was applied to prevent 
overfitting, with a learning rate set to 0.005 and a batch size of 128. In stage two, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was 
implemented using the hmmlearn framework, employing a Gaussian mixture model with two components and covariance 
 6 / 15 
 
fitting restricted to diagonal elements to minimize overfitting. This dual-stage approach ensures robust handling of both 
sequential data and probabilistic state transitions within the dynamic dataset. 
Application of DASH to identify events 
For full FRET sequences 𝑋= (𝑋!, 𝑋", … , 𝑋#), where each sequence 𝑋$ = (𝑥$,!, 𝑥$,", … 𝑥$,&)  consists of two-color 
fluorescence signals, the bi-LSTM-CRF layer is designed to predict the segmentation label 𝑦)$,&  for 𝑥$,& . Here, 𝑦)$,& 
represents a label from the label set ℒ. The final classification includes three types: {donor photobleached, acceptor 
photobleached, discarded}. The label set ℒ follows the BIO (Begin-Intermediate-Omit) format commonly used in Named 
Entity Recognition (NER) literature and is defined as ℒ= {𝑂, 𝑑𝑏', 𝑑𝑏$, 𝑑𝑏(, 𝑎𝑏', 𝑎𝑏$, 𝑎𝑏(}, where 'db' stands for donor 
photobleached and 'ab' stands for acceptor photobleached. The 'O' label represents the discarded type and is omitted from 
further analysis. The suffixes 'b,' 'i,' and 'e' denote the beginning, intermediate, and end of a labeled segment, respectively.  
After bi-LSTM layer, we get embeddings ℎ$,& for signals 𝑥$,&, and CRF layer then applies a linear transformation to 
compute the emission scores for each label: 
𝐸$,& = 𝑊ℎ$,& + 𝑏 
 
The CRF layer defines a structured probability distribution over possible label sequences using emission scores 𝐸$,& 
and transition scores 𝐴*+,*, which represents the transition matrix for moving from label 𝑦) to label y. The score of a 
sequence 𝑌7 given an input 𝑋 is: 
 
𝑆(𝑋$, 𝑌$) = :𝐸&,*(",$) + :𝐴*(",$&'),*(",$) 
,
&
,
&-!
 
Where the first term sums the emission scores of the chosen labels, the second term sums the transition scores of 
consecutive labels. The model computes the partition function 𝑍(𝑋$), summing over all possible label sequences 𝑌.<: 
𝑍(𝑋$) = : 𝑆(
/(0
𝑋$, 𝑌.< ) 
The loss function is negative log-likelihood of the correct sequence 𝑌$, 
ℓ123 = −: log exp (S(𝑋$, 𝑌$))
𝑍(𝑋$)

$
 
In contrast to prior work employing CNN-LSTM-based models, DASH utilizes a bi-LSTM-CRF architecture, where 
the CRF layer optimizes transitions between different labels when generating the classification result. In terms of loss 
function, bi-LSTM optimizes categorical cross-entropy for individual labels, whereas bi-LSTM-CRF maximizes the 
likelihood of the entire label sequence by considering both emission and transition probabilities. Although bi-LSTM is 
computationally more efficient, bi-LSTM-CRF introduces additional complexity due to sequence-level normalization and 
decoding but significantly enhances accuracy in structured sequence labeling tasks. For example, the model avoids 
outputting sequences where a "db_i" (donor photobleached, intermediate) label precedes a "db_b" (donor photobleached, 
beginning) label, thereby enhancing the accuracy of sequential classification and the reliability of trace interpretation.

In stage 2, the task becomes an unsupervised task since we don’t have the labels. We define a subset of sequence 
elements where the predicted label is not “O”. The final output for stage 2 is a discrete state 𝑧$,& assigned to 𝑠$,&.

The advantage of using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layers in the biLSTM-CRF architecture, compared to 
CNN+LSTM models, lies in their ability to model dependencies between output labels explicitly. CRFs are particularly 
effective for structured prediction tasks, such as sequence labeling, because they consider the relationships between 
neighboring labels, ensuring globally optimal label assignment. This is crucial in tasks like trace classification in single-
molecule fluorescence experiments, where the transitions between states (e.g., donor photobleached, acceptor 
photobleached) are interdependent and follow specific patterns. While CNN+LSTM architectures focus on feature 
extraction and temporal dependencies, they lack mechanisms to enforce label consistency across the sequence.                    
Statistics and reproducibility 
All statistical analyses were conducted using the Origin 2021 (OriginLab Corporation) software or PYTHON. Three 
repeats were performed to ensure the consistency and reliability of the data. No data were excluded from the analyses, and 
the sample sizes were not predetermined using statistical methods.

Figure 1. Workflow of trace classification performance of DASH. (a) DASH consists of two stages: trace classification 
and state assignment. Bi-LSTM refers to Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, while FC layer represents the Fully 
Connected layer. CRF stands for Conditional Random Field, and HMM represents Hidden Markov Model. (b) Examples 
of traces classified as ‘donor photobleaching’ (top) and ‘acceptor photobleaching’ (bottom) are shown. ‘Donor 
photobleaching’ is characterized by the simultaneous disappearance of both donor and acceptor, whereas ‘acceptor 
photobleaching’ is defined by the acceptor disappearing first, followed by the donor. Green represents the donor, while red 
indicates the acceptor. The black lines depict double-strand DNA. (c) Confusion matrices illustrate the differences between 
predicted classifications and labeled data. D bleached refers to donor photobleaching, and A bleached indicates acceptor 
photobleaching. N represents the number of traces, and F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. (d) The difference 
in photobleaching time points between predictions and labels is presented, with an exposure time of 100 ms per frame.

Figure 3. Automatic sorting based on DASH of AsCas12a with fully matched target DNA. (a) Illustrations and a typical 
single-molecule fluorescence trace depict the corresponding states of Cas12a during DNA cleavage. Cy3 (green dot) is 
attached to the 3' end of crRNA, while Cy5 (red dot) is linked to the target DNA strand, positioned 28 nucleotides 
downstream of the PAM sequence. State 1 (S1) corresponds to the complex with initial R-loop formation, State 2 (S2) 
represents the non-target strand (NTS) cleavage state, and States 3 and 4 (S3 and S4) correspond to the target strand (TS) 
cleavage states. (b) Representative single-molecule FRET trajectories of AsCas12a cleavage are shown, with four distinct 
FRET states indicated and assigned as S1 to S4, ranging from low to high values. The green line represents the donor 
fluorophore (Cy3), while the red line represents the acceptor fluorophore (Cy5). (c) Time-dependent FRET probability 
density plots are presented, synchronized at the appearance of FRET (t = 0, left panel) or at the disappearance of FRET (t 
= 0, middle panel). These plots allow for careful examination of FRET changes in the Cas12a/crRNA/DNA complex after 
formation or prior to the disassembly of the ternary complex, respectively. (d) Time-dependent FRET probability density 
plot based on automatic sorting of the number of states present in an event. (e-g) Time-dependent FRET probability density 
plot based of certain pattern appearing in an event within 1 state (e), 2 states (f), and 3 states (g) categories, please refer to 
Supplementary Table 7 for complete sorting results based on DASH. (h) A double pie chart illustrates transient trace 
transition times, with different shades of the same color representing the same number of transitions but differing patterns. 
The exposure time for each frame is 500 ms. N represents the number of traces analyzed.

probability density plots of all fluorescent events (a), automatic sorting by number of states present in an event (c), and a 
double pie chart illustrates transient trace transition times (b) of AsCas12a with 3MM. (d-f) Time-dependent FRET 
probability density plots of all fluorescent events (d), automatic sorting by number of states present in an event (f), and a 
double pie chart illustrates transient trace transition times (e) of AsCas12a with 6MM. (g-i)Time-dependent FRET 
probability density plots of all fluorescent events (g), automatic sorting by number of states present in an event (h), and a 
double pie chart illustrates transient trace transition times (i) of AsCas12a with 7MM. In pie chart, different shades of the 
same color represent the times of transitions is the same but the pattern is different. 3 MM, 6 MM, and 7 MM stand for 
DNA targets containing 3, 6, and 7 PAM-distal mismatches, respectively, towards crRNA at their PAM-distal ends. Please 
refer to Supplementary Tables 7-9 for complete sorting results based on DASH. The exposure time for each frame is 500 
ms. N represents the number of traces analyzed.
